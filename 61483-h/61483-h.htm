  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The differences of opinion among political
economists have of late been a frequent
subject of complaint; and it must be
allowed, that one of the principal causes
of them may be traced to the different
meanings in which the same terms have
been used by different writers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The object of the present publication is,
to draw attention to an obstacle in the
study of political economy, which has now
increased to no inconsiderable magnitude.
But this could not be done merely by
laying down rules for the definition and application
of terms, and defining conformably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>to them. It was necessary to show the difficulties
which had resulted from an inattention
to this subject, in some of the most popular
works on political economy; and this has
naturally led to the discussion of certain important
principles and questions of classification,
which it would be most desirable to
settle previously, as the only foundation for
a correct definition and application of terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are the reasons for the arrangement
and mode of treating the subject which has
been adopted.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.</span><br /> <span class='large'>RULES FOR THE DEFINITION AND APPLICATION OF TERMS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In a mathematical definition, although the
words in which it is expressed may vary, the
meaning which it is intended to convey is
always the same. Whether a <em>straight</em> line be
defined to be a line which lies evenly between
its extreme points, or the shortest line which
can be drawn between two points, there never
can be a difference of opinion as to the lines
which are comprehended, and those which are
not comprehended, in the definition.</p>

<p class='c011'>The case is not the same with the definitions
in the less strict sciences. The classifications
in natural history, notwithstanding all
the pains which have been taken with them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>are still such, that it is sometimes difficult to
say to which of two adjoining classes the individuals
on the confines of each ought to
belong. It is still more difficult, in the sciences
of morals and politics, to use terms which may
not be understood differently by different persons,
according to their different habits and
opinions. The terms virtue, morality, equity,
charity, are in every-day use; yet it is by no
means universally agreed what are the particular
acts which ought to be classed under
these different heads.</p>

<p class='c011'>The terms liberty, civil liberty, political
liberty, constitutional government, <em>&amp;c.</em> <em>&amp;c.</em>, are
frequently understood in a different sense by
different persons.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has sometimes been said of political economy,
that it approaches to the strict science
of mathematics. But I fear it must be acknowledged,
particularly since the great deviations
which have lately taken place from the
definitions and doctrines of Adam Smith, that
it approaches more nearly to the sciences of
morals and politics.</p>

<p class='c011'>It does not seem yet to be agreed what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>ought to be considered as the best definition
of wealth, of capital, of productive labour, or
of value;—what is meant by real wages;—what
is meant by labour;—what is meant by
profits;—in what sense the term ‘demand’ is
to be understood,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> <em>&amp;c.</em> <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>As a remedy for such differences, it has
been suggested, that a new and more perfect
nomenclature should be introduced. But
though the inconveniences of a new nomenclature
are much more than counterbalanced by
its obvious utility in such sciences as chemistry,
botany, and some others, where a great
variety of objects, not in general use, must be
arranged and described so as best to enable us
to remember their characteristic distinctions;
yet in such sciences as morals, politics, and
political economy, where the terms are comparatively
few, and of constant application in the
daily concerns of life, it is impossible to suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>that an entirely new nomenclature would
be submitted to; and if it were, it would not
render the same service to these sciences, in
promoting their advancement, as the nomenclatures
of Linnæus, Lavoisier, and Cuvier, to
the sciences to which they were respectively
applied.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under these circumstances, it may be desirable
to consider what seem to be the most
obvious and natural rules for our guidance in
defining and applying the terms used in the
science of political economy. The object to
be kept in view should evidently be such
a definition and application of these terms,
as will enable us most clearly and conveniently
to explain the nature and causes of the
wealth of nations; and the rules chiefly to be
attended to may, perhaps, be nearly included
in the four following:—</p>

<p class='c011'>First. When we employ terms which are
of daily occurrence in the common conversation
of educated persons, we should define
and apply them, so as to agree with the
sense in which they are understood in this
ordinary use of them. This is the best and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>more desirable authority for the meaning of
words.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly. When the sanction of this authority
is not attainable, on account of further distinctions
being required, the next best authority
is that of some of the most celebrated
writers in the science, particularly if any one
of them has, by common consent, been considered
as the principal founder of it. In this
case, whether the term be a new one, born
with the science, or an old one used in a new
sense, it will not be strange to the generality of
readers, nor liable to be often misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it may be observed, that we shall not
be able to improve the science if we are thus
to be bound down by past authority. This
is unquestionably true; and I should be by
no means inclined to propose to political economists
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurare in verba magistri</span>,” whenever
it can be clearly made out that a change
would be beneficial, and decidedly contribute
to the advancement of the science. But it
must be allowed, that in the less strict sciences
there are few definitions to which some plausible,
nay, even real, objections are not to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>made; and, if we determine to have a new
one in every case where the old one is not
quite complete, the chances are, that we shall
subject the science to all the very serious disadvantages
of a frequent change of terms,
without finally accomplishing our object.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is acknowledged, however, that a change
may sometimes be necessary; and when it is,
the natural rules to be attended to seem to be,</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly. That the alteration proposed
should not only remove the immediate objections
which may have been made to the terms
as before applied, but should be shown to be
free from other equal or greater objections,
and on the whole be obviously more <em>useful</em>
in facilitating the explanation and improvement
of the science. A change which is
always itself an evil, can alone be warranted
by superior utility taken in the most enlarged
sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fourthly. That any new definitions adopted
should be consistent with those which are
allowed to remain, and that the same terms
should always be applied in the same sense,
except where inveterate custom has established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>different meanings of the same word; in
which case the sense in which the word is used,
if not marked by the context, which it generally
is, should be particularly specified.</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot help thinking that these rules for
the definitions in political economy must be
allowed to be obviously natural and proper,
and that if changes are made without attention
to them, we must necessarily run a great
risk of impeding, instead of promoting, the
progress of the science.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, although these rules appear to be so
obvious and natural, as to make one think it
almost impossible that they should escape
attention, it must be acknowledged that they
have been too often overlooked by political
economists; and it may tend to illustrate
their use and importance; and possibly excite
a little more attention to them in future; to
notice some of the most striking deviations
from them in the works of writers of the
highest reputation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span><br /> <span class='large'>ON THE DEFINITION OF WEALTH BY THE FRENCH ECONOMISTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It will not be worth while to advert to the
misnomers of the mercantile system; but the
system of the French Economists was a scientific
one, and aimed at precision. Yet it
must be acknowledged that their definition of
wealth violated the first and most obvious rule
which ought to guide men of science, as well
as others, in the use of terms. Wealth and
riches are words in the commonest use; and
though all persons might not be able at once
to describe with accuracy what they mean
when they speak of the wealth of a country,
yet all, we believe, who intend to use the term
in its ordinary sense, would agree in saying
that they <em>do not</em> confine the term either to the
gross raw produce, or the neat raw produce
of such country. And it is quite certain that
two countries, with both the same gross raw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>produce, and the same neat raw produce,
might differ most essentially from each other
in a great number of the most universally acknowledged
characteristics of wealth, such as
good houses, good furniture, good clothes,
good carriages, which, in the one case, might
be possessed only by a few great landlords, and
a small number of manufacturers and merchants;
and in the other case, by an equal, or
greater proportion of landlords, and a much
greater number of manufacturers and merchants.
This difference might take place
without any difference in the amount of the
raw produce, the neat produce, or the population,
merely by the conversion of idle retainers
and menial servants into active artisans and
traders. The result, therefore, of comparing
together the wealth of different countries, according
to the sense of that term adopted by
the Economists, and according to the sense in
which it is generally understood in society,
would be totally different. And this circumstance
detracts in a very great degree from the
practical utility of the works of the Economists.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span><br /> <span class='large'>ON THE DEFINITION AND APPLICATION OF TERMS BY ADAM SMITH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In adverting to the terms and definitions
of Adam Smith, in his “Wealth of Nations,”
I think it will be found that he has
less frequently and less strikingly deviated
from the rules above laid down, and that
he has more constantly and uniformly kept in
view the paramount object of explaining in the
most intelligible manner the causes of the
wealth of nations, according to the ordinary
acceptation of the expression, than any of
the subsequent writers in the science, who
have essentially differed from him. His faults
in this respect are not so much that he has
often fallen into the common error, of using
terms in a different sense from that in which
they are ordinarily applied in society, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>that he is sometimes deficient in the precision
of his definitions; and does not always,
when adopted, adhere to them with sufficient
strictness.</p>

<p class='c011'>His definition of wealth, for instance, is
not sufficiently accurate; nor does he adhere
to it with sufficient uniformity: yet it cannot
be doubted that he means by the term
generally the material products which are
necessary, useful, and agreeable to man, and
are not furnished by nature in unlimited
abundance; and I own I feel quite convinced
that it is in this sense in which it is most
generally understood in society, and in which
it may be most usefully applied, in explaining
the causes of the wealth of nations.</p>

<p class='c011'>In adopting the labour which a commodity
will command as the measure of its value, he
has not, as it appears to me, given the most
conclusive reasons for it, nor has he in all
cases made it quite clear whether he means
the labour which a commodity will command,
or the labour worked up in it. He
has more frequently failed in not adhering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>practically to the measure he had proposed,
and in substituting as an equivalent the
quantity of corn a commodity will command,
which, as a measure of value, has properties
essentially distinct from labour. Yet, with
all this, it must be acknowledged that he
has generally used the terms labour and
value in the sense in which they are ordinarily
understood in society, and has, with
few exceptions, applied labour as the measure
of value in the way in which it may be made
most extensively useful in the explanation of
the science.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been sometimes objected to Adam
Smith, that he has applied the term <em>productive</em>
in a new and not very appropriate sense.
But if we examine the manner in which this
term is applied in ordinary conversation and
writing, it must be allowed that, whatever
meaning may be thought to attach to it, from
its derivation, it is practically used as implying
causation in regard to almost any
effect whatever. Thus we say that such and
such things are productive of the best effects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>others of the very worst effects, and others
are unproductive of, or do not produce, any
perceptible effects; meaning by these expressions,
that some things cause the best effects,
others the worst effects, others, again, cause
no perceptible effects; and these effects may,
of course, apply according to the context,
and the subject under discussion, to the
health of the body, the improvement of the
mind, the structure of society, or the wealth
of a nation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, Adam Smith was inquiring into the
nature and causes of the wealth of nations;
and having confined the term <em>wealth</em> to material
objects, and described human labour as
the main source of wealth, he clearly saw the
necessity of making some distinction between
those different kinds of labour which, without
reference to their utility, he could not but observe
had the most essentially distinct effects,
in directly causing that wealth, the nature of
which he was investigating. He called one of
these kinds of labour <em>productive</em>, or productive
of wealth, and the other <em>unproductive</em>, or not
productive of wealth; and knowing that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>would occasion interminable confusion, and
break down all the barriers between production
and consumption, to attempt to estimate
the circumstances which might <em>indirectly</em> contribute
to the production of wealth, he described
productive labour in such a way, as
to leave no doubt that he meant the labour
which was so directly productive of wealth, as
to be estimated in the quantity or value of the
material object produced.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his application of the terms <em>productive</em>
and <em>unproductive</em>, therefore, he does not
seem to have violated the usage of common
conversation and writing; and it appears to
me, that, if we fully and impartially consider
the consequences of making no distinction between
different kinds of labour, we must feel
the conviction that the terms which he has
adopted are pre-eminently useful for the purpose
to which they are applied—that is, to
enable him to explain, intelligibly and satisfactorily,
the causes of the wealth of different nations,
according to the ordinary meaning which
men attach to the term wealth, whatever may
be their theories on the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Where Adam Smith has most failed in the
use of his terms, is in the application of the
word <em>real</em>. The <em>real</em> value of a commodity
he distinctly and repeatedly states to be the
quantity of <em>labour</em> which it will command, in
contradistinction to its nominal value, that is,
its value in money, or any other specific commodity
named. But while he is thus using
the word real, in this sense, he applies it to
wages in a totally different sense, and says,
that the <em>real</em> wages of labour are the necessaries
and conveniencies of life which the money
received by the labourer will enable him to
command. Now, it must be allowed that both
these modes of applying the word <em>real</em>, cannot
be correct, or consistent with each other. If
the value of labour varies continually with the
varying quantity of the necessaries and conveniencies
of life which it will command, it is
completely inconsistent to bring it forward as
a measure of real value. And if it can, with
propriety, be brought forward as a measure
of the real value of commodities, it follows
necessarily that the average value of a given
quantity of labour, of a given description, can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>never be considered as in the slightest degree
affected by the varying quantity of commodities
for which it will exchange. Of this Adam
Smith seemed to be fully aware in the fifth
chapter of his first book, where he says distinctly,
that when more or less goods are
given in exchange for labour, it is the goods
that vary, not the labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is evident, therefore, that to get right, we
must cease to use the term <em>real</em>, in one or
other of the meanings in which it has been
applied by Adam Smith.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the term had never been applied in political
economy in a different sense from that
in which it was first used by Adam Smith,
there could be no doubt that it might be advantageously
continued, and the expression
<em>real value</em> might answer its purpose very
well, and save any question respecting the
substitution of some other term, such as intrinsic,
positive, absolute, or natural. But
as the term <em>real</em> has been very generally applied,
by most writers, to wages, implying
the real quantity of the means of subsistence
and comfort which the labourer is enabled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>command, in contradistinction to his nominal
or money wages, the matter cannot be so easily
settled, and we must come to some determination
as to which of the two meanings it
would be most advisable to reject.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adhering to the rules which have been laid
down, it will probably be acknowledged that
the term <em>real</em>, when applied to the means of
obtaining something in exchange, seems more
naturally to imply the power of commanding
the necessaries, conveniencies, and luxuries of
life, than the power of commanding labour.
A certain quantity of wealth is something more
<em>real</em>, if the word real be used in its most
ordinary sense, than a certain quantity of labour;
and if, on this account, we continue to
apply the term real to wages, we must express
by positive, absolute, intrinsic, or natural,
what Adam Smith has expressed by the
word real, as applied to value: or it would be
still better if political economists would agree
in assigning a distinct meaning to the term value,
as contradistinguished from price, whenever
the value of a commodity is mentioned
without mentioning any specific article in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>it is proposed to estimate it, in the same manner
as the price of a commodity is universally
understood to mean price in money, whenever
the term is used without referring specifically
to some other article.</p>

<p class='c011'>If, however, it should be found that the
term <em>real</em>, in the sense in which it is first and
most frequently applied by Adam Smith, has
by usage got such fast hold of this meaning,
that it cannot easily be displaced; and, further,
if it be thought that an adjunct of this kind to
the term value will sometimes be wanted in
explanations, and that to express what Adam
Smith means, the term real is preferable to
either of the terms intrinsic, positive, absolute,
or natural, there would be little objection
to letting it retain its first meaning, provided
we took care not to use it in application
to the wages of labour, as implying the necessaries,
conveniencies, and amusements of
life. Instead of <em>real</em> wages, we must then say
corn wages, commodity wages, wages in the
means of subsistence, or something of the kind.
But the other change is obviously more simple,
and therefore in my opinion preferable.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV.</span><br /> <span class='large'>APPLICATION OF THE TERM UTILITY BY M. SAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It would lead me too far and into too many
repetitions, if I were to go through the principal
definitions of the continental political
economists, and examine the manner in which
they have used their terms in reference to the
obvious rules above laid down; but I cannot
resist noticing one very signal deviation from
them in the justly distinguished work of M.
Say. It relates to the term <em>utility</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be allowed by those who are acquainted
with M. Say’s work, first, that he has
used the term utility in a sense totally different
from that in which it is used in common conversation,
and in the language of those who
are considered as the best authorities in political
economy. Proceeding upon the principle,
that nothing can be valuable which is
not useful to some person or other, he has
strangely identified utility and value, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>made the utility of a commodity proportionate
to its value, although the custom is universal
of distinguishing between that which is useful
and that which is merely high-priced, of that
which is calculated to satisfy the acknowledged
and general wants of mankind, and
that which may be only calculated to satisfy
the capricious tastes of a few. He has thus
violated the first and most obvious rule for the
use of terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, he has gone directly against the
usage of the best writers in political economy,
and particularly against the authority of
Adam Smith, whom he himself considers as
the main founder of the science. Adam Smith
has declared his opinion in the most decided
manner on this subject, by contrasting value
in use, and value in exchange, and illustrating
the distinction between them by adducing the
marked instances of a diamond and water.
M. Say, therefore, in the manner in which
he has applied the term utility, has violated
the second obvious rule for the use of terms,
as well as the first.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly, the objections to the old terms in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>use, wealth and value, if there were any, do
not by any means seem to have been such as
to warrant the introduction of a new term.
The object of M. Say seems to have been to
show, that production does not mean production
of new matter in the universe, but I cannot
believe that even the Economists had this
idea; and it is quite certain that Adam Smith’s
definition of production completely excludes it.
“There is one sort of labour,” he says, “which
adds to the value of the subject on which it is
bestowed&nbsp;*&thinsp;*&thinsp;* and as it produces a value may
be called productive.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> There is, certainly, no
question here about the creation of new matter.
And as M. Say observes, that when things
are in their ordinary and natural state their
value is the measure of their utility, while he
had before affirmed that riches were in proportion
to value,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> it is difficult to conceive what
beneficial purpose he could have in view in
introducing the term utility thus made synonymous
with value or riches.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Fourthly, as the terms useful and utility
are in such very common use, when applied
in their accustomed sense, and cannot easily
be supplied by others, it is extremely difficult
to confine their application to the new
sense proposed by M. Say. It is scarcely
possible not to use them sometimes, as M. Say
himself has done, according to their ordinary
acceptation; but this necessarily introduces
uncertainty and obscurity into the language
of political economy.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Say had before made little or no distinction
between riches and value, two terms
which Mr. Ricardo justly considers as essentially
different. He then introduces another
term, utility, which, as he applies it, can hardly
be distinguished from either of the others.
The new term, therefore, could not have been
called for; and it must be allowed that the
use of it in the sense proposed, violates all
the most obvious rules for the introduction of
a new term into any science.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span><br /> <span class='large'>ON THE DEFINITION AND APPLICATION OF TERMS BY MR. RICARDO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Although it must be allowed that the criterion
of value which Mr. Ricardo has endeavoured
to establish is an incomplete one, yet
I cannot but think that he has conferred an
important benefit on the science of political
economy, by drawing a marked line of distinction
between riches and value. A difference
had perhaps been felt by most writers,
but none before him had so strongly marked
it, and attached so much importance to it. He
agrees entirely with Adam Smith in the following
definition of riches: “Every man is
rich or poor according to the degree in which
he can afford to enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies,
and amusements of human life.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
And adds an observation in which I think he
is quite right. “Value, then, essentially differs
from riches; for value depends not on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>abundance, but on the difficulty or facility of
production.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> He subsequently says, “although
Adam Smith has given the correct
description of riches which I have more than
once noticed, he afterwards explains them differently,
and says that a man must be rich
or poor, according to the quantity of labour
which he can afford to purchase. Now this
description differs essentially from the other,
and is certainly incorrect; for suppose the
mines were to become more productive, so
that gold and silver fell in value, from the
greater facility of production; or that velvets
were to be manufactured by so much less labour
than before, that they fell to half their
former value; the riches of all those who purchased
these commodities would be increased;
one man might increase the quantity of his
plate, another might buy double the quantity
of velvet; but with the possession of this additional
plate and velvet, they could employ
no more labour than before, because, as the
exchangeable value of velvet and of plate
would be lowered, they must part with proportionably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>more of these species of riches to
purchase a day’s labour. Riches then cannot
be estimated by the quantity of labour which
they will purchase.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In these remarks I entirely agree with
Mr. Ricardo. If riches consist of the necessaries,
conveniencies, and luxuries of life, and
the same quantity of labour will at different
times, and under different circumstances, produce
a very different quantity of the necessaries,
conveniencies, and luxuries of life, then
it is quite clear that the power of commanding
labour, and the power of commanding the necessaries,
conveniencies and luxuries of life are
essentially distinct. One, in fact, is a description
of value, and the other of wealth.</p>

<p class='c011'>But though Mr. Ricardo has fully succeeded
in showing that Adam Smith was incorrect in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>confounding wealth and value, even according
to his own descriptions of them; yet he has
nowhere succeeded in making out the propriety
of that peculiar view of value which
forms the most prominent feature of his work.</p>

<p class='c011'>He has not confined himself to the assertion,
that what he calls the value of a commodity
is determined by the quantity of labour worked
up in it; but he states, in substance, the following
proposition, that commodities exchange
with each other according to the quantity of
manual labour worked up in them, including
the labour worked up in the materials and
tools consumed in their production, as well as
that which is more immediately employed.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now this proposition is contradicted by
universal experience. The slightest observation
will serve to convince us, that after
making all the required allowances for temporary
deviations from the natural and ordinary
course of things, the class of commodities
subject to this law of exchange is most extremely
confined, while the classes, not subject
to it, embrace the great mass of commodities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Mr. Ricardo, indeed, himself admits of considerable
exceptions to his rule; but if we
examine the classes which come under his
exceptions, that is, where the quantities of
fixed capital employed are different and of
different degrees of duration, and where the
periods of the returns of the circulating capital
employed are not the same, we shall find that
they are so numerous, that the rule may be
considered as the exception, and the exceptions
the rule.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, notwithstanding these admissions, he
proceeds with his rule as if there had been
few or no exceptions to it: he especially estimates
the value of wages by the quantity of
human labour worked up in them; and as it is
quite true, that if we look only to this element
of value, the value of wages has a tendency to
rise in the progress of cultivation and improvement,
he has attributed the fall of profits which
usually takes place in rich countries to the
rise in the value of wages; and, in fact, has
founded his whole theory of profits, which has
been considered as the crowning achievement
in the science, upon the rise and fall in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>value of wages. “It has been my endeavour,”
he says, “to show throughout this work, that
the rate of profits can never be increased but
by a fall of wages.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Again he observes,
“Profits—it cannot be too often repeated—depend
on wages; not on nominal but real
wages; not on the number of pounds which
may be annually paid to the labourer, but on
the number of days’ work necessary to obtain
these pounds.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Real wages, then, according to Mr. Ricardo’s
definition, are determined by the quantity
of labour worked up in the articles, which
the labourer receives as a remuneration for his
labour, whether food and clothing, or money.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the meaning here attached to the term
real wages, on which Mr. Ricardo’s theory of
profits is made to depend, is quite unusual,
and decidedly contradicts all the most obvious
rules which suggest themselves for the application
of terms in any science.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, no one we believe ever
heard, before the time of Mr. Ricardo, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>term used in conversation in such a manner,
that an increase of real wages would
generally imply a diminution in the means
of subsistence and comfort among the labouring
classes and their families. Yet this
would be the case, according to the sense
in which Mr. Ricardo uses the term. Speaking
of the different situations of the landlord
and the labourer, in the progress of
society, after describing the increasing wealth
of the landlord, he says, “The fate of the
labourer will be less happy; he will receive
more money-wages it is true, (and the money
of Mr. Ricardo is here used as measuring
what he calls real wages;) but his corn wages
will be reduced; and not only his command
of corn, but his general condition will be deteriorated.”
With a continued increase of
real wages, “the condition of the labourer will
generally decline, while the condition of the
landlord will always be improved.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, No writer that I have met with,
anterior to Mr. Ricardo, ever used the term
wages, or real wages, as implying proportions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Profits, indeed, imply proportions; and the
rate of profits had always justly been estimated
by a per centage upon the value of the
advances. But wages had uniformly been
considered as rising or falling, not according
to any <em>proportion</em> which they might bear to
the whole produce obtained by a certain quantity
of labour, but by the greater or smaller
quantity of any particular produce received
by the labourer, or by the greater or smaller
power which such produce would convey, of
commanding the necessaries and conveniencies
of life. Adam Smith in particular had often
used the term <em>real wages</em>, and always in the
most natural sense possible, as implying the
necessaries and conveniencies of life, which,
according to the common language and feelings
of men, might justly be considered as
more <em>real</em> than money, or any other particular
article in which the labourer might be paid.
And the use of the term, in this sense, by
Adam Smith, and most other political economists,
necessarily made the new interpretation
given to it more strange, and more unwarranted.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Thirdly, There were no objections to the
sense in which the term was before applied.
It was both natural and useful. Nor was a
new interpretation of it wanted for the purpose
of explanation. All the effects of the
wages of labour upon profits might have
been clearly described, by stating, that profits
are determined by the proportion of the whole
produce which goes to pay the wages of labour,
without calling this proportion, whether
small or great in quantity, <em>the real wages of
labour</em>, and without asserting that, as the value
of wages rises, profits must proportionably
fall. That profits are determined by the proportion
of the whole produce which goes to
pay the wages of labour, is a proposition,
which, when correctly explained, will be found
to be true, and to be confirmed by universal
experience; while the proposition, that as
the value of wages rises profits proportionably
fall, cannot be true, except on the assumption
that commodities, which have the same quantity
of labour worked up in them, are always
of the same value, an assumption which probably
will not be found to be true in one case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>out of five hundred; and this, not from accidental
or temporary causes, but from that
natural and necessary state of things, which,
in the progress of civilisation and improvement,
tends continually to increase the quantity
of fixed capital employed, and to render
more various and unequal the times of the
returns of the circulating capital. The introduction,
therefore, of a new meaning of the
term <em>real wages</em>, has not certainly the recommendation
of being more useful.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fourthly, the new sense in which the term
real wages is used, is not maintained with
consistency, or applied to old facts and opinions,
with a proper allowance for the change
that has been made. This is almost unavoidable,
when old terms, which are quite familiar
in one sense, are applied in another and different
sense. It is particularly remarkable in
Mr. Ricardo’s use of his artificial money, which
is meant to be the measure of real wages.
Thus, he says, “It may be proper to observe,
that Adam Smith, and all the writers who
have followed him, have, without one exception
that I know of, maintained, that a rise in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the price of labour would be uniformly followed
by a rise in the price of all commodities. I
hope I have succeeded in showing that there
are no grounds for such an opinion, and that
only those commodities would rise which had
less fixed capital employed upon them than
the medium in which price was estimated, and
that all those which had more would positively
fall in price when wages rose. On the contrary,
if wages fell, those commodities only
would fall which had a less proportion of fixed
capital employed upon them than the medium
in which price was estimated; all those which
had more would positively rise in price.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now all these effects of a rise or fall in the
wages of labour, depend entirely upon wages
being estimated in Mr. Ricardo’s imaginary
money. Estimated in this way, and in this
way alone, Mr. Ricardo’s statement would be
correct. But neither Adam Smith, nor any of
his followers, down to the time of Mr. Ricardo,
ever thought of estimating the price of wages
in this way. And estimating them in the way
to which they were always accustomed, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>is in money, as they found it, they are quite
justified in what they have said. According
to Adam Smith, at least, who estimates the
value of commodities by the quantity of labour
which they will command, if the money wages
of labour universally rise, the value of money
proportionably falls; and when the value of
money falls, Mr. Ricardo himself says, that
the prices of goods always rise.</p>

<p class='c011'>The difference, therefore, between Mr. Ricardo
and Adam Smith in this case, arises
from Mr. Ricardo’s forgetting that he was
using the term price of labour in a different
sense from that in which it was used in the
proposition objected to.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the same manner, Mr. Ricardo’s very
startling proposition respecting the effects of
foreign trade, namely, that “no extension of
foreign trade will immediately increase the
amount of <em>value</em> in a country,” arises entirely
from his using the term value in a different
sense from that in which it had been used by
his predecessors.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the value of foreign commodities imported
is to be estimated by the quantity of labour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>worked up in the commodities sent out to purchase
them, then it is quite true that, whatever
may be the returns, their value is unsusceptible
of increase. But if the value of foreign
commodities imported be estimated in the
way in which they had ever been estimated
before, that is, either in the money, in the
labour, or in the mass of commodities which
they would command when brought home,
then there cannot be the least doubt that the
<em>immediate</em> effect of a prosperous venture which
gives great profits to the merchants concerned
would be to increase the amount of value in
the country. The value of the returns compared
with the value of the outgoings would,
in this particular trade, be greater than usual;
and it is quite certain, that this increase of
value in one quarter would not necessarily
be counterbalanced by a decrease of value in
any other. Practically, indeed, nothing is
more usual than a simultaneous rise in the
value of the great mass of commodities from
a prosperous trade, whether this value be estimated
in money or in labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be allowed, then, that Mr. Ricardo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>has been very far from cautious in the definition
and application of his terms, in treating
of some of the most fundamental principles of
political economy; and I have very little
doubt, as I have stated elsewhere, that this is
one of the reasons why many of the readers
of his work have found great difficulty in understanding
it. When old and very familiar
terms are used in a new sense, it is scarcely
possible for the writer to be always consistent
in their application, and extremely difficult to
the reader always to be aware of the sense
meant to be affixed to them.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span><br /> <span class='large'>ON THE DEFINITION AND APPLICATION OF TERMS BY MR. MILL, IN HIS “ELEMENTS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Mill, in his <cite>Elements of Political Economy</cite>,
professedly lays no claim to discovery.
His main object seems to have been to give
the substance of Mr. Ricardo’s work in a more
concentrated form, and with a better arrangement;
and this object he has accomplished.
In the definition and application of his terms
he nearly follows Mr. Ricardo; but it may be
useful to notice a few cases, where he has
either made the errors of Mr. Ricardo’s definitions
more prominent, or has altered without
improving them.</p>

<p class='c011'>On his first approach to the question of
value, he describes the causes which determine
it much more inaccurately than Mr. Ricardo.
He says, that “the value of commodities
is determined by the <em>quantity</em> of capital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and labour necessary to produce them.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> But
this is obviously untrue and quite inconsistent
with what he says afterwards respecting the
regulator of value. It may be correct, and I
fully believe it is, to estimate the value of
labour by its <em>quantity</em>; but how can we estimate
the value of different kinds of machinery,
or different kinds of raw materials by their
<em>quantity</em>? The <em>quantity</em> of raw material contained
in a coarse and thick piece of calico, as
compared with a very fine and thin piece of
muslin, worked up by the same quantity of
labour, may be four or five times greater, while
the value of it, and the degree in which it
affects the value of the commodity, may be
actually less. We cannot, in short, measure
the value of any product of labour by its bulk
or quantity; and it must therefore be essentially
incorrect to say, that the value of commodities
is determined by the quantity of capital
and labour necessary to produce them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Proceeding afterwards to investigate more
minutely what it is, which in the last resort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>determines the proportion in which commodities
exchange for one another, he observes,
that “as all capital consists in commodities,
it follows, of course, that the first capital must
have been the result of pure labour. The
first commodities could not be made by any
commodities existing before them. But if the
first commodities, and of course the first capital,
were the result of pure labour, the value of
this capital, the quantity of other commodities
for which it would exchange, must have been
estimated by labour. This is an immediate
consequence of the proposition which we have
just established, that where labour was the
sole instrument of production, exchangeable
value was determined by the quantity of labour
which the production of the commodity required.
If this be established, it is a necessary
consequence that the exchangeable value
of all commodities is determined by quantity
of labour.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now this necessary consequence, which is
here so confidently announced, does not appear
to me to follow either from this statement, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>from any thing which is said subsequently.
Allowing that the first commodities, if completed
and brought into use immediately, might
be the result of pure labour, and that their
value would therefore be determined by the
quantity of that labour; yet it is quite impossible
that such commodities should be employed
as capital to assist in the production of
other commodities, without the capitalist being
deprived of the use of his advances for a certain
period, and requiring a remuneration in the
shape of profits.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early periods of society, on account
of the comparative scarcity of these advances
of labour, this remuneration would be high,
and would affect the value of such commodities
to a considerable degree, owing to the high
rate of profits. In the more advanced stages
of society, the value of capital and commodities
is largely affected by profits, on account
of the greatly increased quantity of fixed capital
employed, and the greater length of time
for which much of the circulating capital is
advanced before the capitalist is repaid by
the returns. In both cases, the rate at which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>commodities exchange with each other, is
essentially affected by the varying amount of
profits. It is impossible, therefore, to agree
with Mr. Mill, when he says, “It appears by the
clearest evidence, that quantity of labour in the
last resort determines the proportion in which
commodities exchange for one another.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>On the same grounds Mr. Mill is quite incorrect,
in calling capital hoarded labour. It
may, perhaps, be called hoarded labour and
profits; but certainly not hoarded labour alone,
unless we determine to call profits labour.
This Mr. Mill himself could not but see; and
consequently, in his second edition, he has
deserted Mr. Ricardo, and boldly ventured to
say, that “profits are in reality the measure
of quantity of labour.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> But as this very peculiar
and most unwarranted abuse of terms
belongs, I believe, originally to Mr. Macculloch,
it may be best to defer the more particular
examination of it, till I come to consider the
definitions and application of terms adopted
by Mr. Macculloch.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>In a work like that of Mr. Mill, which has
so much the air of logical precision, one should
have hoped and expected to find superior accuracy
in the definitions, and great uniformity
in the application of his terms, in whatever
sense he might determine to use them; but
in this the reader will be disappointed. It is
difficult, for instance, to infer from the language
of Mr. Mill, whether a commodity is to be
considered as altering in its value in proportion
to its costs of production, or in proportion
to its power of commanding other commodities,
and they are certainly not the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the commencement of his seventh section,
of chap. iii., entitled, “<cite>What regulates
the Value of Money</cite>,” he says,</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the value of money is here to be understood
the proportion in which it exchanges
for other commodities, or the quantity of it
which exchanges for a certain quantity of other
things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This is, to be sure, a very lax description
of the value of money, very inferior in point of
accuracy, even to what would be understood
by <em>the general power of purchasing</em>. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>are the things a certain quantity of which is
here alluded to? and if these things change in
the costs of their production, will money be
proportionally affected?</p>

<p class='c011'>But we have a different and better description
of value in the next section. It is there
said, that “gold and silver are, in reality,
commodities. They are commodities for the
attainment of which labour and capital must
be employed. It is cost of production which
determines the value of these as of other ordinary
productions.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if cost of production determines the
value of money, it follows that, while the cost of
producing a given quantity of money remains
the same, its value remains the same. But it is
obvious that the value of money may remain
the same in this sense of the term, while, owing
to the alterations which may be taking place
in the costs of producing the commodities alluded
to, the quantity of other things for which
it will exchange may be essentially different.
Which of the two, then, is the true criterion
of the value of money? It is surely most desirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>that the student in political economy
should not be left in the dark on this subject;
yet Mr. Mill gives him no assistance; and he
is left to decide between two very different
meanings as well as he can.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, perhaps, the most culpable confusion
of terms which Mr. Mill has fallen into, is in
relation to demand and supply; and as he has
a more original and appropriate claim to this
error than any other English writer, and its
belief leads to very important consequences,
the notice of it is particularly called for.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, no person can have turned
his attention, in the slightest degree, to the
language of political economy, either in conversation
or books, without being fully aware
that the term demand is used in two very
distinct senses; one implying the quantity of
the commodity consumed, and the other the
amount of sacrifice which the purchasers are
willing to make in order to obtain a given
portion of it. In the former sense, an increase
of demand is but very uncertainly connected
with an increase of value, or a further encouragement
to production, as in general the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>greatest increase of such kind of demand takes
place in consequence of a very abundant
supply and a great fall in value. It is the
other sense alone to which we refer, when we
speak of the demand compared with the supply
as determining the values and prices of commodities;
and in this latter sense of the term
demand, which, perhaps, is in the most frequent
use, an increase of supply is so far from
increasing demand that it diminishes it, while
a diminution of demand increases it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, it has been generally agreed,
that when the quantity of a commodity brought
to market is neither more nor less than sufficient
to supply all those who are able and
willing to give the natural and necessary price
for it, the demand may then, and then only,
be said to be equal to the supply; because,
if the quantity wanted by those who are able
and willing to give the natural price exceed
the supply, the demand is said to be greater
than the supply, and the price rises above
the ordinary costs of production; and if the
quantity wanted by those who are able and
willing to give the natural price fall short of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the supply, the demand is said to be less than
the supply, and the price falls below the ordinary
costs of production. This is the language
of Adam Smith, and of almost all writers on
political economy, as well as the language of
common conversation when such subjects are
discussed. Indeed it is difficult to conceive
in what other sense it could, with any propriety,
be said, that the supply was equal to the demand,
because in any other sense than this,
the supply of a commodity might be said to
be equal to the demand, whether it were selling
at double or the half of its cost.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly, it must be allowed, that according
to the best authorities in books and conversation,
what is meant by the glut of a particular
commodity is such an abundant supply of it
compared with the demand as to make its
price fall below the costs of production; and
what is meant by a <em>general</em> glut, is such an
abundance of a large mass of commodities of
different kinds, as to make them all fall below
the natural price, or the ordinary costs of production,
without any proportionate rise of price
in any other equally large mass of commodities.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>With these preliminary definitions, we may
proceed to examine some of the arguments
by which Mr. Mill endeavours to show that
demand and supply are always equal in the
aggregate; that an over supply of some commodities
must always be balanced by a proportionate
under supply of others; and that,
therefore, a general glut is impossible.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Mr. Mill had always strictly adhered to
that meaning of the term <em>demand for a commodity</em>
which signifies the quantity consumed,
he might have maintained the position with
which he heads the third section of his fourth
chapter, namely, <em>that consumption is co-extensive
with production</em>. This, however, is, in
reality, no more than saying, that if commodities
were produced in such abundance as to
be sold at half their cost of production, they
would still be somehow or other consumed—a
truism equally obvious and futile. But
Mr. Mill has used the term demand in such a
way, that he cannot shelter himself under this
truism. He observes, “It is evident that
whatever a man has produced, and does not
wish to keep for his own consumption, is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>stock which he may give in exchange for
other commodities. His will, therefore, to
purchase, and his means of purchasing, in
other words, his demand, is exactly equal to
the amount of what he has produced, and
does not mean to consume.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Here it is evident that Mr. Mill uses the term
demand in the sense of the amount of sacrifice
which the purchaser is able to make, in order
to obtain the commodity to be sold, or, as Mr.
Mill correctly expresses it, his means of purchasing.
But it is quite obvious that his means
of purchasing other commodities are not proportioned
to the <em>quantity</em> of his own commodity
which he has produced, and wishes to part
with; but to its <em>value in exchange</em>; and unless
the value of a commodity in exchange be proportioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to its quantity, it cannot be true
that the demand and supply of every individual
are always equal to one another. According
to the acknowledged laws of demand
and supply, an increased quantity will often
lower the value of the whole, and actually
diminish the means of purchasing other commodities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Mill asks, “What is it that is necessarily
meant, when we say that the supply and
the demand are accommodated to one another?
It is this (he says) that goods which
have been produced by a certain quantity of
labour, exchange for goods which have been
produced by an equal quantity of labour. Let
this proposition be attended to, and all the
rest is clear. Thus, if a pair of shoes is produced
by an equal quantity of labour as a hat,
so long as a hat exchanges for a pair of shoes,
so long the supply and demand are accommodated
to one another. If it should so happen
that shoes fell in value, as compared with
hats, which is the same thing as hats rising
in value, as compared with shoes, this would
imply that more shoes had been brought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>market, as compared with hats. Shoes would
then be in more than due abundance. Why?
Because in them the produce of a certain
quantity of labour would not exchange for the
produce of an equal quantity. But for the
very same reason, hats would be in less than
due abundance, because the produce of a certain
quantity of labour in them would exchange
for the produce of more than an equal
quantity in shoes.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now, I have duly attended, according to
Mr. Mill’s instructions, to the proposition
which is to make all the rest clear; and yet
the conclusions at which he wishes to arrive,
appear to me as much enveloped in darkness
as ever. This, indeed, was to be expected
from the proposition itself, which obviously
involves a most unwarranted definition of what
is meant, when we say that the supply and the
demand are accommodated to one another.
It has already been stated that what has hitherto
been meant, both in conversation and
in the writings of the highest authority on
political economy, by the supply being accommodated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>to, or equal to the demand, is, that
the supply is just sufficient to accommodate
all those who are able and willing to pay the
natural and necessary price for it, in which
case, of course, it will always sell at what
Adam Smith calls its natural price.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, unless Mr. Mill is ready to maintain
that people would still say that the supply of
a commodity was accommodated to the demand
for it, whether it were selling at three
times the cost of its production, or only one-third
of that cost, he cannot maintain his definition.
He cannot, for instance, deny that
hats and shoes may be both selling below the
costs of production, although they may exchange
for each other in such proportions, that
the hats produced by a certain quantity of
labour may exchange for the shoes produced
by the same quantity of labour. But can it
be said on this account, that the supply of
hats is suited to the demand for hats, or the
supply of shoes suited to the demand for
shoes, when they are both so abundant that
neither of them will exchange for what will
fulfil the conditions of their continued supply?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>And supposing that, while both are selling below
the costs of production, shoes should fall
still lower than hats, what would be the consequence?
According to Mr. Mill, “shoes
would then be in more than due abundance.
Why? Because in them the produce of a
certain quantity of labour would not exchange
for the produce of an equal quantity. But for
the very same reason, hats would be in less
than due abundance, because the produce of
a certain quantity of labour in them would
exchange for the produce of more than an
equal quantity in shoes.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It will be most readily allowed that, in the
case supposed, shoes will be in more than due
abundance, though not for the reason given
by Mr. Mill. But how can it be stated, with
the least semblance of truth, that hats would
be in less than due abundance, when, by the
very supposition, they are selling at a price
which will not re-purchase the quantity of labour
employed in producing them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing can show more distinctly than the
very case here produced by Mr. Mill, that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>proposition or definition, which is to clear up
everything, is wholly inapplicable to the question;
and that to represent the abundance or
deficiency of the supply of one commodity, as
determined by the deficiency or abundance of
another, is to give a view of the subject totally
different from the reality, and calculated
to lead to the most absurd conclusions. There
is hardly any stage of society subsequent to
the division of labour, where the state of the
supply compared with the demand of shoes is
essentially affected by the state of the supply
compared with the demand for hats; and in
the present state of society in this country,
where the question of a general glut has arisen,
it is still more irrelevant to advert to any other
objects as efficient causes of demand for a particular
commodity, except those which relate
to the costs of producing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hop-planter who takes a hundred bags
of hops to Weyhill fair, thinks little more
about the supply of hats and shoes than he
does about the spots in the sun. What does he
think about, then? and what does he want to
exchange his hops for? Mr. Mill seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>be of opinion that it would show great ignorance
of political economy, to say that what
he wants is money; yet, notwithstanding the
probable imputation of this great ignorance,
I have no hesitation in distinctly asserting, that
it really is money which he wants, and that
this money he must obtain, in the present state
of society, in exchange for the great mass of
what he has brought to market, or he will be
unable to carry on his business as a hop-planter;
and for these specific reasons; first,
that he must pay the rent of his hop grounds
in money; secondly, that he must pay for his
poles, his bags, his implements, &amp;c., &amp;c., in
money; thirdly, that he must pay the numerous
labourers which he employs on his
grounds, during the course of the next year,
in money; and fourthly, that it is in money,
and in money alone of all the articles brought
to the fair, that he can calculate his profits.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is perfectly true, that both the landlords
and the labourers who are paid in money will
finally exchange it for something else, as no
one enjoys money <em>in kind</em>, except the miser;
but the landlord who may spend perhaps a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>good deal in post-horses, dinners at inns, and
menial servants, would be little likely to accept
from the hop-planter the articles which
he could get at the fair in exchange for his
hops; and though the expenditure of the labourer
is much more simple, and may be said
to consist almost entirely in food and clothing,
yet it is quite certain that the power of commanding
a given quantity of labour can never
be represented, with any approach towards
correctness, by a given quantity of corn and
clothing. As a matter of fact, the labourer
in this country is paid in money; and while it
often happens that for many years together
the money-price of labour remains the same,
the money-price of corn is continually altering,
and the labourer may, perhaps, receive the
value of twice as much corn in one year as
he does in another.</p>

<p class='c011'>What an entirely false view, then, does it
give of the real state of things, what a complete
obscuration instead of illustration of the
subject is it, to represent the demand for shoes
as determined by the supply of hats, or the demand
for hops by the supply of cloth, cheese,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>or even corn. In fact, the doctrine that one
half of the commodities of a country necessarily
constitute an adequate market or effectual
demand for the other half, is utterly without
foundation. The great producers who are
the great sellers, before they can venture to
think about the supplies of hats, shoes, and
cloth, on which they may perhaps expend a
tenth part of a tenth part of what they have
brought to market, must first direct their
whole attention to the replacing of their
capital, and to the question whether, after replacing
it, they will have realized fair profits.
Whatever may be the number of intermediate
acts of barter which may take place in regard
to commodities—whether the producers send
them to China,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> or sell them in the place
where they are produced: the question as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>an adequate market for them, depends exclusively
upon whether the producers can replace
their capitals with ordinary profits, so as to
enable them successfully to go on with their
business.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what are their capitals? They are, as
Adam Smith states, the tools to work with,
the materials to work upon, and the means
of commanding the necessary quantity of labour.
Colonel Torrens, therefore, is quite
right, when he says, “that an increased production
of those articles which do not form
component parts of capital, cannot create an
increased effectual demand, either for such
articles themselves, or for those other articles
which do form component parts of capital.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
And, perhaps, he may be considered as making
some approaches towards the truth, when he
says, that “effectual demand consists in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>power and inclination, on the part of consumers,
to give for commodities, either by immediate
or circuitous barter, some greater
proportion of all the ingredients of capital than
their production costs.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> But in this latter
position, he is still very far from representing
what actually takes place. When we
consider how much labour is directly employed
in the production of the great mass of commodities,
and recollect further, that raw materials
and machinery, the other two branches
of capital, are mainly produced by labour, it
is obvious that the power of replacing capitals
will mainly depend on the power of commanding
labour: but a given quantity of what
Colonel Torrens calls the ingredients of capital,
can never represent a given quantity of
labour; and consequently, if a given quantity
of labour be necessary in any production, a
very different quantity of the ingredients of
capital would be required at different times, to
occasion the same effectual demand for it. It
is far, therefore, from being true, that if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>ingredients of capital, represented by a hundred
and ten quarters of corn, and a hundred
and ten suits of clothing, were increased to
“two hundred and twenty quarters of corn,
and two hundred and twenty suits of clothing,
the effectual demand for the article would
be doubled.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is still further from the truth, “that increased
supply is the one and only cause of
increased effectual demand;”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> and most happy
is it for mankind that this is not true. If it
were, how difficult would it be for a society
to recover itself, under a temporary diminution
of food and clothing! But by a kind provision
of nature, this diminution, within certain
limits, instead of diminishing, will increase
effectual demand. The theory of demand and
supply, shows that the food and clothing thus
diminished in quantity, will rise in value; and
universal experience tells us, that, as a matter
of fact, the money-price of the remaining food
and clothing will for a time rise in a greater
degree than in proportion to the diminution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of its quantity, while the money-price of labour
may remain the same. The necessary
consequence will be, the power of setting in
motion a greater quantity of productive industry
than before.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>There is no assumption so entirely fatal to
a just explanation of what is really taking
place in society, as the assumption, that the
natural wages of labour in food and clothing
are always nearly the same, and just about
sufficient to maintain a stationary population.
All the most common causes of an acceleration
or retardation in the movements of the
great machine of human society, involve variations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and often great variations, in the real
wages of labour. Commodities in general,
and corn most particularly, are continually
rising or falling in money-price, from the state
of the supply as compared with the demand,
while the money-price of labour remains much
more nearly the same. In the case of a rise
of corn and commodities, the real wages of
common day-labour are necessarily diminished:
the labourer obtains a smaller proportion of
what he produces; profits necessarily rise;
the capitalists have a greater power of commanding
labour; more persons are called into
full work, and the increased produce which
follows, is the natural remedy for that state of
the demand and supply, from whatever cause
arising, which had occasioned the temporary
rise in the money-price of commodities. On
the other hand, if corn and other commodities
fall in money-price, as compared with the
money-price of labour, it is obvious that the
day-labourer, who gets employment, will be
able to buy more corn with the money which
he receives; he obtains a larger proportion of
what he produces; profits necessarily fall; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>capitalists have a diminished power of commanding
labour; fewer persons are fully employed,
and the diminished production which
follows, is the natural remedy for that state of
the demand and supply, from whatever cause
arising, which occasioned the temporary fall
in the money-price of commodities. The operation
of these remedial processes to prevent
the continuance of excess or defect, is so much
what one should naturally expect, and is so
obviously confirmed by general experience,
that it is inconceivable that a proposition
should have obtained any currency which is
founded on a supposed law of demand and
supply diametrically opposed to these remedial
processes.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be recollected, that the question of a
glut is exclusively whether it may be general,
as well as particular, and not whether it may
be permanent as well as temporary. The
causes above mentioned act powerfully to prevent
the permanence either of glut or scarcity,
and to regulate the supply of commodities so
as to make them sell at their natural prices.
But this tendency, in the natural course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>things, to cure a glut or a scarcity, is no more
a proof that such evils have never existed,
than the tendency of the healing processes of
nature to cure some disorders without assistance
from man, is a proof that such disorders
have not existed.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to return more particularly to Mr. Mill.
After asserting that the supply is the demand,
and the demand is the supply, so frequently,
that the unwary reader must feel quite at a
loss to know which is which, he comes to a
distinct conclusion, which is so directly contradicted
both by theory and experience, as
to show either that his premises must have
been false, or that what he calls his indissoluble
train of reasoning consists of mere unconnected
links. He says, “It is therefore
universally true, that as the aggregate demand
and aggregate supply of a nation never can
be unequal to one another, so there never can
be a superabundant supply in particular instances,
and hence a fall in exchangeable
value below the cost of production, without
a corresponding deficiency of supply, and
hence a rise in exchangeable value beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>cost of production in other instances. The
doctrine of the glut, therefore, seems to be
disproved by a chain of reasoning perfectly indissoluble.”<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>While commodities are merely compared
with each other, it is unquestionably true that
they cannot all fall together, or all rise together.
But when they are compared with the
costs of production, as they are in the above
passage, it is evident that, consistently with
the justest theory, they may all fall or rise at
the same time. For what are the costs of
production? They are either the quantity of
<em>money</em> necessary to pay the labour worked up
in the commodity, and in the tools and materials
consumed in its production, with the
ordinary profits upon the advances for the
time that they have been advanced; or they
are the quantity of labour in kind required to
be worked up in the commodity, and in the
tools and materials consumed in its production
with such an additional quantity as is equivalent
to the ordinary profits upon the advances
for the time that they have been advanced.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Now it surely cannot be denied theoretically,
that all commodities produced in this
country may fall in comparison with a commodity
produced in Mexico. As little can
it be denied theoretically that all commodities
produced by British labour may fall as compared
with that labour, either from an unusually
increased supply of such commodities, or a
diminution of demand for them. And when,
from these theoretical concessions, required by
the universally acknowledged laws of demand
and supply, we turn to the facts, we see with
our own eyes, and learn from authority which
there is no reason whatever for doubting, that
a very large mass of commodities does at
times fall below the costs of production,
whether those costs be estimated in money or
labour, without the slightest shadow of pretence
for saying that any other equally large
mass is raised proportionally above the costs
of production.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even within the very last year, it is a matter
of the most public notoriety that the cotton
manufactures, the woollen manufactures, the
linen manufactures, the silk manufactures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>have all fallen below the costs of production,
including ordinary profits. To go no further,
the amount of these manufactures, taken
together, must, on a rough estimate, exceed
seventy millions of pounds sterling. And if
this mass of commodities, partly from over
production and over trading, and partly from
their necessary consequences, the shock to
confidence and credit and the diminution of
bills of exchange and currency, have fallen
below the ordinary costs of production, what
man is there credulous enough to believe that
there must have been, according to the language
of Mr. Mill, “a corresponding deficiency
of supply, and hence a rise of exchangeable
value beyond cost of production
in other instances”? I doubt, indeed, much,
whether satisfactory evidence could be brought
to show that a single million’s worth of goods
has risen above the cost of production, while
seventy millions’ worth have fallen below it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Consequently, if the definition of a general
glut be a fall in a great mass of commodities
below the costs of production, not counterbalanced
by a proportionate rise of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>other equally large mass of commodities above
the costs of production, Mr. Mill’s conclusion
against the existence of a general glut,
founded on “a chain of reasoning perfectly
indissoluble,” seems to be utterly without foundation.</p>

<p class='c011'>If facts so notorious as these to which I
have adverted are either boldly denied, or
considered as undeserving attention, in founding
the theories of political economy, there is
an end at once to the utility of the science.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the subject of the wages of labour,
Mr. Mill has added his authority to the peculiar
views and language of Mr. Ricardo. He
says, “Whatever the share of the labourer,
such is the rate of wages; and, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>,
whatever the rate of wages, such is the share
of the commodity or commodities’ worth which
the labourer receives.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Perhaps the term
<em>rate of wages</em> used by Mr. Mill to express the
proportion of the produce which falls to the
share of the labourer is in some respects preferable
to the term <em>real wages</em>, used by Mr. Ricardo
for the same purpose; but still it is highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>objectionable, because it is an old and familiar
term used in an entirely new sense. When
the expressions high or low rates of wages
were used, before the time of Mr. Ricardo
and Mr. Mill, no one understood them to
mean the proportion of the produce awarded
to the labourer. In fact, this meaning had
not been before conveyed by any appropriate
terms in the language of political economy;
yet it is a meaning the expression of which
was much wanted in explaining the theory of
profits. To express it, therefore, a new term
should certainly have been chosen, and not
an old one, which was familiar in a different
sense. There seems to be no objection to
the term <em>proportionate wages</em>, which has been
used by Mr. Macculloch.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole, it must be allowed, that
Mr. Mill in his <cite>Elements of Political Economy</cite>
has but little attended to the most obvious
rules which ought to guide political economists
in the definition and application of their
terms. They are often unsanctioned by the
proper authorities, and rarely maintained with
consistency.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span><br /> <span class='large'>ON THE DEFINITION AND APPLICATION OF TERMS, BY MR. MACCULLOCH, IN HIS “PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>However incautious Mr. Ricardo and Mr.
Mill may have been in the definition and application
of their terms, I fear it will be found
that Mr. Macculloch has been still more so;
and that, instead of growing more careful, the
longer he considers the subject, he seems to
be growing more rash and inconsiderate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The expositors of any science are in general
desirous of calling into their service
definite and appropriate terms; and for this
purpose their main object is to look for characteristic
differences, not partial resemblances.
Mr. Macculloch, on the other hand,
seems to be only looking out for resemblances:
and proceeding upon this principle,
he is led to confound material with immaterial
objects; productive with unproductive labour;
capital with revenue; the food of the labourer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>with the labourer himself; production with
consumption; and labour with profits.</p>

<p class='c011'>That this is not an exaggerated view of
what has been stated by Mr. Macculloch, in
his <cite>Principles of Political Economy</cite>, any person
who reads the work with attention may satisfy
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch’s definition of wealth, which
he considers as quite unexceptionable, is,
“those articles or products which possess
exchangeable value, and are either necessary,
useful, or agreeable.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is not, perhaps, quite unexceptionable to
use the term value in a definition of wealth.
It is something like explaining <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignotum per
ignotius</span></i>. But independently of this objection,
the definition is so worded, that it is left in
doubt whether immaterial gratifications are
meant to be included in it. They are not in
general designated by the terms <em>articles</em> or
<em>products</em>; and it is only made clear that it is
intended to include them by a collateral remark
on my definition of wealth, which I confine
specifically to material objects, and by a subsequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>definition of productive labour, which
is made to include every gratification derived
from human exertion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch, in the article on Political
Economy which he published in the Supplement
to the Encyclopædia Britannica, had
excluded these kinds of gratification from his
definition of wealth, and had given such reasons
for this exclusion, as would fully have convinced
me of its propriety, if I had not been convinced
before. He observes that, “if political economy
were to embrace a discussion of the production
and distribution of all that is useful and
agreeable, it would include within itself every
other science; and the best Encyclopædia would
really be the best treatise on political economy.
Good health is useful and delightful, and therefore,
on this hypothesis, the science of wealth
ought to comprehend the science of medicine:
civil and religious liberty are highly useful,
and therefore the science of wealth must comprehend
the science of politics: good acting
is agreeable, and therefore, to be complete,
the science of wealth must embrace a discussion
of the principles of the histrionic art, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>so on. Such definitions are obviously worse
than useless. They can have no effect but to
generate confused and perplexed notions respecting
the objects and limits of the science,
and to prevent the student ever acquiring a
clear and distinct idea of the inquiries in which
he is engaged.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>On these grounds he confined wealth to
material products; but, in the same treatise,
he included, in his definition of productive labour,
all those sources of gratification which
he had, with such good reason, excluded from
his definition of wealth. When he had done
this, however, he could not but be struck with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the inconsistency of saying that wealth consisted
exclusively of material products, and
yet that all labour was equally productive of
wealth, whether it produced material products
or not. To get rid of this inconsistency, he
has now altered his definition, by leaving out
the term material products; and it remains
to be seen, whether in so doing he has not
essentially deviated from the most obvious
rules which should direct us in defining our
terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>His definition of wealth, as explained by
what he subsequently says of productive labour,
now includes all the gratifications derived
from menial service and followers, whatever
may be their number.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now let us suppose two fertile countries
with the same population and produce, in one
of which it was the pride and pleasure of the
landlords to employ their rents chiefly in
maintaining menial servants and followers,
and in the other, chiefly in the purchase of
manufactures and the products of foreign
commerce. It is evident that the different
results would be nearly what I described in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>speaking of the consequences of the definition
of the Economists. In the country, where the
tastes and habits of the landlords led them to
prefer material conveniencies and luxuries,
there would, in the first place, be in all probability
a much better division of landed
property; secondly, supposing the same agricultural
capital, there would be a very much
greater quantity of manufacturing and mercantile
capital; and thirdly, the structure of
society would be totally different. In the one
country, there would be a large body of persons
living upon the profits of capital; in the other,
comparatively a very small one: in the one,
there would be a large middle class of society;
in the other, the society would be divided
almost entirely between a few great landlords
and their menials and dependents: in
the one country, good houses, good furniture,
good clothes, and good carriages, would be
in comparative abundance; while in the other,
these conveniencies would be confined to a
very few.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, I would ask, whether it would not be
the grossest violation of all common language,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and all common feelings and apprehensions, to
say that the two countries were equally rich?</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch, however, has discovered
that there is a resemblance between the end
accomplished by the menial servant or dependent,
and by the manufacturer or agriculturist.
He says, “The end of all human
exertion is the same; that is, to increase
the sum of necessaries, comforts, and enjoyments;
and it must be left to the judgment
of every one to determine what proportion
of these comforts he will have in the
shape of menial services, and what in the
shape of material products.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It will, indeed, be readily allowed, that
even the third footman who stands behind a
coach, and seems only to add to the fatigue
of the horses and the wear and tear of the
carriage, is still employed to gratify some
want or wish of man, in the same manner as
the riband maker or the lace maker. It will
further be readily allowed, that it is by no
means politic to interfere with individuals in
the modes of spending their incomes. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>does it at all follow from this, that if these
different kinds of labour have very different
effects on society in regard to wealth, as the
term is understood by the great mass of mankind,
that they should not be distinguished
by different appellations, in order to facilitate
the explanation of these different effects?
Mr. Macculloch might unquestionably discover
some resemblance between the salt and the
meat which it seasons: they both contribute,
when used in proper proportions, to compose
a palatable and nutritive meal, and in general
we may leave it to the taste and discretion
of the individual to determine these proportions;
but are we on that account to confound
the two substances together, and to
affirm that they are <em>equally</em> nutritive? Are
we to define and apply our terms in such a
way as to make it follow from our statements,
that, if the individual were to compound his
repast of half salt and half meat, it would
equally conduce to his health and strength?</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Macculloch states, that a taste for
the gratifications derived from the unproductive
labourers of Adam Smith “has exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the same effect upon national wealth as a
taste for tobacco, champagne, or any other
luxury.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> This may be directly denied,
unless we define wealth in such a manner as
will entitle us to say that the enjoyments
derived by a few great landlords, from the
parade of menial servants and followers, will
tell as effectually in an estimate of wealth as a
large mass of manufacturers and foreign commodities.
But when M. Chaptal endeavoured
to estimate the wealth of France, and Mr. Colquhoun
that of England, we do not find the
value of these enjoyments computed in any
of their tables. And certainly, if wealth
means what it is understood to mean in common
conversation and in the language of the
highest authorities in the science of Political
Economy, no effects on national wealth can
or will be more distinct than those which
result from a taste for material conveniencies
and luxuries, and a taste for menial servants
and followers. The exchange of the ordinary
products of land for manufactures, tobacco,
and champagne necessarily generates capital;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and the more such exchanges prevail the
more do those advantages prevail which
result from the growth of capital and a better
structure of society; while an exchange of
necessaries for menial services, beyond a certain
limited amount, obviously tends to check
the growth of capital, and, if pushed to a considerable
extent, to prevent accumulation
entirely, and to keep a country permanently
in a semi-barbarous state.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch, when not under the influence
of his definition, justly observes, that
“the great practical problem, involved in
that part of the science of political economy
which treats of the production of wealth, must
resolve itself into a discussion of the means
whereby the greatest amount of necessary,
useful, and desirable products may be obtained
with the least possible quantity of
labour.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> But among the unproductive
labourers of Adam Smith there is no room for
such saving of labour. The pre-eminent advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to be derived from capital, machinery,
and the division of labour, are here
almost entirely lost; and in most instances the
saving of labour would defeat the very end in
view, namely, the parade of attendance, and
the pride of commanding a numerous body of
followers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if the employment of the labour required
to produce material conveniencies and
luxuries necessarily occasions the creation and
distribution of capital, and, further, affords
room for all the advantages resulting from
the saving of labour and the most extended
use of machinery; while the employment of
the labour, called by Adam Smith unproductive,
is necessarily cut off from all these
benefits, I would ask whether these two circumstances
<em>alone</em> do not form a sufficiently
marked line of distinction amply to justify the
classification of Adam Smith; and the utility
of such a classification, in explaining the
<em>causes</em> of the wealth of nations, is most obvious
and striking.</p>

<p class='c011'>So difficult is it, consistently, to maintain
a definition which contradicts the common
usage of language, and the common feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of mankind, that I have not the least doubt,
if Mr. Macculloch himself were to travel
through two countries of the kind before
described, that is, one flourishing in manufactures
and commerce, and the other, though
with the same population and food, furnishing
little more to the great mass of its people
than <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">panem et Circenses</span></i>, he would call the
latter poor, and the former comparatively
rich.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, what must have been the cause of
this difference? Adam Smith would give a
simple, sufficient, and most intelligible reason
for it. He would say, that the number and
powers of those whom he had called productive
labourers, had been much greater in one
country than in the other. This seems to be
a clear and satisfactory explanation. How
Mr. Macculloch could explain the matter
according to doctrines which make no difference
between the different kinds of labour,
I am utterly at a loss to conjecture<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Perhaps, however, he would say, upon recollection,
that his definition of wealth did not
oblige him to allow that there would really
be any difference in the wealth of these two
countries. In that case, I think it may be
very safely said that his definition of wealth
violates all the most obvious rules for the
definition and application of terms. It is opposed
to the meaning of the term wealth as
used in common conversation; it is opposed
to the meaning of the term wealth as applied
by the writers of the highest authority in
political economy; it is so far from removing
the little difficulties which had attended
former definitions of wealth and productive
labour, that it very greatly aggravates them;
it so contradicts our common habits and feelings,
that it is scarcely possible to maintain it
with consistency.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch’s definition of capital has
exactly the same kind of character as his definition
of wealth, namely, that of being so
extended as to destroy all precision, and to
confound objects which had before been most
usefully separated, with a view to the explanation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>of the causes of the wealth of nations.
The alteration of a definition seems with Mr.
Macculloch to be a matter of very slight consequence.
The following passage is certainly
a most extraordinary one. “The capital of
a country may be defined to be <em>that portion
of the produce of industry existing in it, which
can be made directly available, either to the
support of human existence, or to the facilitating
of production</em>. This definition differs
from that given by Dr. Smith, which has been
adopted by most other economists. The
whole produce of industry belonging to a
country, is said to form its <em>stock</em>; and its
capital is supposed to consist of that portion
only of its stock, which is employed in the
view of producing some species of commodities.
The other portion of the stock of a
country, or that which is employed to maintain
its inhabitants, without any immediate
view to production, has been denominated its
<em>revenue</em>, and is not supposed to contribute
anything to the increase of its wealth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“These distinctions seem to rest on no good
foundations. Portions of stock employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>without any immediate view to production,
are often by far the most productive. The
stock, for example, that Arkwright and Watt
employed in their own consumption, and without
which they could not have subsisted, was
laid out as <em>revenue</em>; and yet it is quite certain
that it contributed infinitely more to increase
their own wealth, as well as that of the country,
than any equal quantity of stock expended
on the artisans in their service. It is always
extremely difficult to say whether any portion
of stock is, or is not, productively employed;
and any definition of capital which involves
the determination of this point, can only serve
to embarrass and obscure a subject that is
otherwise abundantly simple. In our view of
the matter, it is enough to constitute an article
capital, if it can either directly contribute to
the support of man, or assist him in appropriating
or producing commodities; but the
question respecting the mode of employing
an article ought certainly to be held to be,
what it obviously is, perfectly distinct from
the question whether that article is capital.
For any thing that we can <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</span></i> know to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the contrary, a horse yoked to a gentleman’s
coach may be just as productively employed
as if he were yoked to a brewer’s dray, though
it is quite plain, that whatever difference may
really obtain in the two cases, the identity of
the horse is not affected; he is equally possessed,
in the one case as well as the other,
of the capacity to assist in production, and
so long as he possesses that capacity, he
ought to be viewed, independently of all other
considerations, as a portion of the capital of
the country.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>If these doctrines were admitted, there
would be an end, at once, of all classifications,
and of all those appropriate designations
which so essentially assist us, in explaining
what is going forward in society. If the distinction
between the whole mass of the products
of a country, and those parts of it which
are applied to perform particular functions,
rests on no solid foundation, it may be asked,
on what better foundation does the distinction
between the mass of the male population of a
country, and the classes of lawyers, physicians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>manufacturers, and agriculturists rest? They
all equally come under the general denomination
of men; but particular classes are
most usefully distinguished by particular appellations
founded on the particular functions
which they generally perform.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bread which I consume myself, or give
to a menial servant, is a part of the general
produce of the country, and may not be different
from that which is advanced to a manufacturer
or agriculturist. When I or my
servant consume the bread, it performs a
most necessary and important service, no less
than the maintenance of life and health; but
in obtaining this service my wealth is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro
tanto</span></i> diminished. On the other hand, if I
give the same kind of bread as wages to a
manufacturer or agricultural labourer, it will
not, with regard to me, perform so necessary
an office as before, but it will perform an
essentially different one with regard to my
wealth, it will increase my wealth instead of
diminishing it. In an inquiry into the causes
of the wealth of nations, does not this difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>in the functions which the same advances
perform require to be marked by a particular
appellation?</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, both in the language of common
conversation and of the best writers,
revenue and capital have always been distinguished;
by revenue being understood, that
which is expended with a view to immediate
support and enjoyment, and by capital, that
which is expended with a view to profit. But
in the language of Mr. Macculloch, in the
passage above quoted, it is the capacity to
perform particular functions, and not the
habitual performance of them, that justifies
particular designations. A coach-horse, drawing
a chariot in the Park, has the capacity
of being employed in a brewer’s dray or a
farmer’s waggon: “whatever difference
may really obtain in the two cases, the
identity of the horse is not affected; he is
equally possessed, in the one case as in the
other, of the capacity to assist in production;
and so long as he possesses that capacity, he
ought to be viewed, independently of all other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>considerations, as a portion of the capital of
the country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This appears to me to be very little different
from saying that a man who is capable
of being made to perform the functions of
a judge ought to be denominated a judge;
because, whether he sits on the bench or in
the court below, the identity of the man is
the same; he is equally possessed, in the one
case as well as the other, of the capacity to
assist in the decision of causes, and so long
as he possesses that capacity he ought to be
viewed, independently of all other considerations,
as one of the judges of the country.
It is said, that the French are astonished at
the small number of judges in England.
If this kind of comprehensive nomenclature
were adopted, their wonder would soon
cease.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole of the incomes of every person
in a society, in whatever way they may be
actually employed, might be employed, as
far as they would go, directly in the support
of man. Consequently, according to the definitions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of Mr. Macculloch, all incomes are
capital. But he is not satisfied even with
this very unusually-extended meaning of the
term. He can trace a resemblance between
a working man and a working horse, and is,
consequently, led to say, “However extended
the sense previously attached to the
term capital may at first sight appear, I am
satisfied that it ought to be interpreted still
more comprehensively. Instead of understanding
by capital all that portion of the produce
of industry extrinsic to man, which may
be applicable to his support, and to the facilitating
of production, there does not seem to be
any good reason why man himself should not,
and very many why he should, be considered
as forming a part of the national capital.
Man is as much the produce of labour as any
of the machines constructed by his agency;
and it appears to us, that in all economical
investigations he ought to be considered in
precisely the same point of view.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>That there is some resemblance between a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>working man and a working horse cannot for
a moment be doubted; but is that sufficient
reason why they should be confounded together
under the name of capital? The question
is not whether there is a partial resemblance
between these two objects, but whether there
is a characteristic difference; and surely
there is a sufficient distinction in all economical
investigations between a free man, and
the horse, the machine, or the food which he
uses, to warrant a different designation, especially
when one of the greatest objects of all
economical investigations, and certainly the
most worthy, has been how to secure at all
times a full sufficiency of the produce of industry
extrinsic to man as compared with man
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been hitherto usual to say, that the
happiness of the labouring classes of society
depends chiefly upon the rate at which the
capital of the country increases, compared
with its population; but if the capital of the
country includes its population, there is no
meaning in the statement. Yet hardly any
writer that I know of has more frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>made this statement than Mr. Macculloch
himself. Nothing, indeed, can show more
strikingly the extreme difficulty of maintaining
consistently new and unusual definitions,
than the frequency with which he seems to be
compelled to use terms in their old and accustomed
sense, notwithstanding the different
definitions which he has given of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, in his very peculiar and most untenable
argument on the effects of absenteeism
in Ireland, one of the reasons which he gives,
why the absence of the landlords does not
diminish the wealth of that country is, that
they do not remove any <em>capital</em> from it, but
merely what they would spend on their own
gratifications. If, however, the definition of
the capital of a country, as stated by Mr. Macculloch,
be “<em>that portion of the produce of industry
existing in it</em> which can be made
directly available either to the support of
human existence or to the facilitating of production,”
it follows necessarily that they remove
a considerable quantity of capital, as it
will hardly be denied that the corn, cattle,
and butter produced from their estates (which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>after all the mystery about bills of exchange
is done away, are practically the main articles
exported to England for the payment of their
rents) may be made directly available to the
support of human existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch is also disposed to recommend
emigration as one of the best means of
relieving the distress of Ireland, by altering
the proportion between capital and labour;
but if, according to him, in all economical
discussions, man is to be considered as capital,
precisely like the machine which he uses or
the food which he consumes, the emigration
of a portion of the population will be to deprive
the country of a portion of its capital,
which has always been considered as most
pernicious. Whatever, therefore, may be
the merits or demerits of Mr. Macculloch’s
reasoning on these subjects, independently of
his definitions, it is obvious that the application
of his definitions at once destroys it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It need hardly be repeated, that in all the
less strict sciences, definitions and classifications
are seldom perfect and complete; but
no reasonable man will refuse to take advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>of an imperfect instrument which is essentially
useful, if no other more perfect one
can be obtained. If it be found useful, with
a view to an explanation of the causes of the
wealth of nations, to make a distinction between
the labours of agriculturists and manufactures,
as compared with menial servants,
followers, and buffoons, the utility of this
distinction is not destroyed, though its perfect
accuracy may be impeached, because, in
a few instances, the labour of the menial
servant is very similar to that of the productive
labourer. The classification is formed
upon the general character and general effects
of one sort of industry as compared with another;
and if, in these respects, the line of
distinction is sufficiently marked, it is mere
useless cavilling to dwell upon particular
instances.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>But even in the very case on which Mr.
Macculloch lays his principal stress, the difference
is such as fully to warrant a different
classification. It is, no doubt, true that, to
have a fire in an attic in London, it is equally
necessary that the coals should be brought
up stairs from the cellar, as that they should
be brought up from the bottom of the coal-mine
to the surface: it is equally true that
there is some resemblance between carrying
coals from the bottom of a house to the top,
and carrying them from the bottom of a mine
to the top; but there is still a most decided
and characteristic difference in the two cases.</p>

<p class='c011'>The miner is paid by the owner or worker
of the mine, for the express purpose of increasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>his wealth; the value of the miner’s
labour is, therefore, charged with a profit
upon the price of the coals; and the result
of it would regularly enter into any estimate
of national wealth. But when the same
owner or worker of coal-mines pays a menial
servant for bringing coals up from the yard
to the drawing-room, he pays him for the
express purpose of facilitating and rendering
more convenient and agreeable, the consumption
of that wealth which he had obtained
through the instrumentality of the miner.
The two instruments are used for purposes
distinctly different, one to assist in obtaining
wealth, the other to assist in consuming it.
In an inquiry into the causes of the wealth
of nations, I cannot easily conceive a more
distinct and useful line of demarcation.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the same principle, if it be found useful
with a view to explanations, to distinguish, by
a different name, the stock destined for immediate
consumption, from the stock employed
or kept, with a view to profit, surely
we must not wait to investigate the peculiar
talents of each individual, before we venture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to characterise the nature of his expenditure;
and if we find such men as Arkwright and
Watt<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> most naturally and properly reserving,
for their immediate consumption, the means
of keeping up a handsome or splendid establishment
for the gratification of themselves,
their family, and their friends, make an exception
in their favour, and call such an expenditure
an outlay of capital, instead of a
consumption of revenue, as we should call it
in the case of all ordinary persons. Such an
inquiry would impose a duty upon the writers
in political economy, which it would be perfectly
absurd to attempt to fulfil, as it would
quite defeat the end of the proposed classifications;
and with regard to the distinguished
characters adverted to, it would surely be
most unnecessary. In an estimate of national
wealth, the genius of a Newton or a Milton
is necessarily underrated, which only shows
that there are other sources of admiration
and delight besides wealth. But such men
as Arkwright and Watt are quite safe in the
hands of the political economist. The result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of their genius and labour is exactly of
that description which is estimated in the
very great addition which it makes to the
capital and revenue of the country, in the
most natural and ordinary acceptation of these
terms. And when the effects of their genius
have been estimated in this way, it would not
only lead to inextricable difficulty, but it
would be obviously a double entry, to estimate,
in addition, the value of the men as extraordinary
machines. It would be like estimating
the value of a commodity produced
by a skilful artificer, and then adding his high
wages, and putting both into an estimate of
national wealth.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is difficult to say what may not be
called wealth, or what labour may not be
called productive, in Mr. Macculloch’s nomenclature.
According to his view of the subject,
any sort of exertion, or any sort of consumption
which tends, however <em>indirectly</em>, to encourage
production, ought to be denominated productive;
and before we venture to call the most
trivial sort of exercise or amusement, such as
blowing bubbles, or building houses of cards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>unproductive, we must wait to see whether
the person so employed does not work the
harder for it afterwards.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> But, not to
mention the impossibility of any, the most
useful classification, if such doctrines were
admitted, and we were required to wait
the result in each particular case, and make
exceptions accordingly, I will venture to
affirm, that if we once break down the distinction
between the labour which is so
directly productive of wealth as to be estimated
in the value of the object produced,
and the labour or exertion, which is so indirectly
a cause of wealth, that its effect is incapable
of definite estimation, we must necessarily
introduce the greatest confusion into the
science of political economy, and render the
causes of the wealth of nations inexplicable.
There is no kind of exertion or amusement
which may not, upon this principle, be called
productive. Walking, riding, driving, card-playing,
billiard-playing, &amp;c. &amp;c. may all be,
indirectly, causes of production; and according
to Mr. Macculloch, “it is very like a truism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to say, that what is a cause of production
must be productive.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>But of all the indirect causes of production,
the most powerful, beyond all question,
is consumption.</p>

<p class='c011'>If man were not to consume, how scanty,
comparatively, would be the produce of the
earth. Consumption, therefore, is the main
fundamental cause of production; and if we
are to put indirect causation on a footing with
direct causation, as suggested by Mr. Macculloch,
we must rank in the same class, the
manufacturer and the billiard player, the producer
and the consumer.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is impossible that the science of political
economy should not most essentially suffer
from such a confusion of terms. Nothing
can be clearer, than that, with a view to any
thing like precision, and the means of intelligible
explanation, it is absolutely necessary
to designate by a different name the labour
which is directly productive of wealth, from
that which merely encourages it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another most extraordinary and inconceivable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>misnomer of Mr. Macculloch is, the extension
of the term labour to all the operations
of nature, and every variety of profits.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adam Smith, and all other writers, who
have happened to fall in my way, have meant,
by the term labour, when unaccompanied by
any specific adjunct, the exertions of human
beings; and by the term wages of labour,
the remuneration, whether in produce or money,
paid to those human beings for their
exertions. When Mr. Ricardo stated, that
commodities exchanged with each other according
to the quantity of labour worked up
in them, there cannot be the least doubt that
he meant the quantity of human labour immediately
employed in their production, together
with that portion of human labour worked up
in the fixed and circulating capitals consumed
in aiding such production. And it is undoubtedly
true, referring merely to the relation
of one commodity to another, and supposing
all other things the same; that is,
supposing profits to be the same, the proportion
of fixed and circulating capitals to be the
same, and the duration of the fixed capitals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and the times of the returns of the circulating
capitals the same, that then the relative values
of the commodities will be determined by the
quantity of human labour worked up in each.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Macculloch could not but see that
it was scarcely possible to take up two commodities,
of different kinds, in which all these
things would be the same, and, consequently,
that such a supposition would be so inapplicable
to the mass of commodities, as to be
perfectly useless; and yet, without such a
supposition, the proposition would be obviously
false.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead, however, of correcting Mr. Ricardo’s
proposition, as he was naturally called
upon to do, by adding to the human labour
worked up in the commodity, any other element
which was found ordinarily to affect its
value, and calling it by its ordinary name, he
chose to retain Mr. Ricardo’s language, but
entirely to alter its meaning. There is nothing
that may not be proved by a new definition.
A composition of flour, milk, suet,
and stones is a plum-pudding; if by stones
be meant plums. Upon this principle, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Macculloch undertakes to show, that commodities
do really exchange with each other
according to the quantity of labour employed
upon them; and it must be acknowledged,
that in the instances which he has chosen he
has not been deterred by apparent difficulties.
He has taken the bull by the horns.
The cases are nearly as strong as that of the
plum-pudding.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>They are the two following—namely, that
the increase of value which a cask of wine
acquires, by being kept a certain number of
years untouched in a cellar, is occasioned by
the increased quantity of labour employed
upon it; and that an oak tree of a hundred
years’ growth, worth 25<em>l.</em>, which may not have
been touched by man, beast, or machine for a
century, derives its whole value from labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch acknowledges that Mr. Ricardo
was inclined to modify his grand principle,
that the exchangeable value of commodities
depended on the quantity of labour
required for their production, so far as to allow
that the additional exchangeable value that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>is sometimes given to commodities, by keeping
them after they have been purchased or
produced until they become fit to be used,
was not to be considered as an effect of labour,
but as an equivalent for the profits which
the capital laid out on the commodities would
have yielded had it been actually employed.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
This was looking at the subject in the true
point of view, and showing that he would not
get out of the difficulty by changing the meaning
of the term labour; but Mr. Macculloch
says—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I confess, however, notwithstanding the
hesitation I cannot but feel in differing from
so great an authority, that I see no good reason
for making this exception. Suppose, to
illustrate the principle, that a cask of new
wine, which cost 50<em>l.</em>, is put into a cellar,
and that at the end of twelve months it is
worth 55<em>l.</em>, the question is, whether ought the
5<em>l.</em> of additional value given to the wine to be
considered as a compensation for the time
the 50<em>l.</em> worth of capital has been locked up,
or ought it to be considered as the value of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>additional labour actually laid out on the
wine. I think that it ought to be considered
in the latter point of view, and for this, as it
appears to me a most satisfactory and conclusive
reason, that if we keep a commodity,
as a cask of wine which has not arrived at
maturity, and on which therefore <em>a change or
effect is to be produced</em>, it will be possessed of
additional value at the year’s end; whereas,
had we kept a cask of wine which had <em>already
arrived at maturity</em>, and on which no beneficial
or desirable effect could be produced for a
hundred or a thousand years, it would not
have been worth a single additional farthing.
This seems to prove incontrovertibly that the
additional value acquired by the wine during
the period it has been kept in the cellar is not
a compensation or return for time, but for the
effect or change that has been produced on
it. Time cannot of itself produce any effect,
it merely affords space for really efficient
causes to operate; and it is therefore clear,
that it can have nothing to do with the
value.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>On this passage it should be remarked, in
the first place, that the question stated in it is
not the main question in reference to the new
meaning which Mr. Macculloch must give to
the term labour, in order to make out his
proposition. He acknowledges that the increased
value acquired by the wine is either
owing to the operation of nature during the
year in improving its quality, or to the profits
acquired by the capitalist for being deprived
for a year from using his capital of 50<em>l.</em> in any
other way. But in either case Mr. Macculloch’s
language is quite unwarranted. When he
uses the expression, “<em>additional labour actually
laid out upon the wine</em>,” who could possibly
imagine that, instead of meaning human
labour, he meant the processes carried on by
nature in a cask of wine during the time that
it is kept. This is at once giving an entirely
new meaning to the term labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, further, it is most justly stated by
Mr. Ricardo, that when the powers of nature
can be called into action in unlimited abundance,
she always works <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</span></i>; and her processes
never add to the value, though they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>may add very greatly to the utility of the
objects to which they are applied.</p>

<p class='c011'>This truth is also fully adopted and strongly
stated by Mr. Macculloch himself. “All the
rude products (he says) and all the productive
powers and capacities of nature are gratuitously
offered to man. Nature is not
niggardly or parsimonious; she neither demands
nor receives an equivalent for her
favours. An object which it does not require
any portion of labour to appropriate or to
adapt to our use may be of the very highest
utility, but as it is the free gift of nature, it is
utterly impossible it can be possessed of the
smallest value.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Consequently, as the processes
which are carrying on in the cask of
wine, while it is kept, are unquestionably the
free gift of nature, and are at the service of
all who want them, it is utterly impossible,
even if their effects were ten times greater
than they are, that they should add in the
smallest degree to the price of the wine. It
is, no doubt, perfectly true, as stated by
Mr. Macculloch, that if wine were not improved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>by keeping, it would not be worth a
single additional farthing after being kept a
hundred or even a thousand years. But this
proves nothing but that, in that case, no one
would ever think of keeping wine longer than
was absolutely necessary for its convenient
sale or convenient consumption.</p>

<p class='c011'>The improvement which wine derives from
keeping is unquestionably the cause of its
being kept; but when on this account the
wine-merchant has kept his wine, the additional
price which he is enabled to put upon
it is regulated upon principles totally distinct
from the average degree of improvement
which the wine acquires. It is regulated exclusively,
as stated by Mr. Ricardo, by the
average profits which the capital engaged in
keeping the wine would have yielded if it had
been actively employed; and that this is the
regulating principle of the additional price,
and not the degree of improvement, is quite
certain: because it would be universally allowed
that if, in the case supposed by Mr.
Macculloch, the ordinary rate of profits had
been 20 per cent., instead of 10 per cent., a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>cask of new wine, worth 50<em>l.</em>, after it had been
kept a year, would have been increased in
value 10<em>l.</em> instead of 5<em>l.</em>, although the processes
of nature and the improvement of the
wine were precisely the same in the two
cases; and there cannot be the least doubt,
as I said before, that if the quality of wine, by
a year’s keeping, were ordinarily improved in
a degree ten times as great as at present, the
prices of wines would not be raised; because,
if they were so raised, all wine-merchants
who sold kept wines would be making greater
profits than other dealers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing then can be clearer than that the
additional value of the kept wine is derived
from the additional amount of profits of which
it is composed, determined by the time for
which the capital was advanced and the ordinary
rate of profits.</p>

<p class='c011'>The value of the oak tree of a hundred
years’ growth is derived, in a very considerable
degree, from the same cause; though, in
rich and cultivated countries, where alone it
could be worth 25<em>l.</em>, rent would necessarily
form a part of this value.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>If the number of acorns necessary on an
average to rear one good oak were planted
by the hand of man, they would be planted
on appropriated land; and as land is limited
in quantity, the powers of vegetation in the
land cannot be called into action by every one
who is in possession of acorns, in the same
way as the improving operations of nature
may be called into action by every person
who possesses a cask of wine. But setting
this part of the value aside, and supposing
the acorns to be planted at a certain expense,
it is quite clear, that almost the whole of the
remaining value would be derived from the
compound interest or profits upon the advances
of the labour required for the first
planting of the acorns, and the subsequent
protection of the young trees. A much
larger part, therefore, of the final value of
the tree than of the final value of the wine
would be owing to profits.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if we were to compare an oak tree,
worth 25<em>l.</em>, with a quantity of hardware worth
the same sum, the value of which was chiefly
made up of human labour; and as the reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>why these two objects were of the same value,
were to state that the same quantity of labour
had been worked up in them—we should obviously
state a direct falsity, according to the
common usage of language; and nothing
could make the statement true, but the magical
influence of a new meaning given to the
term labour. But to make labour mean profits,
or fermentation, or vegetation, or rent,
appears to me quite as unwarrantable as to
make stones mean plums.</p>

<p class='c011'>To <em>measure</em> profits by labour is totally a
different thing. Adam Smith always keeps
wages, profits, and rent quite distinct; and
when he mentions one of them, never thinks
of including in the same term any other. But
he observes, that “labour <em>measures</em> the value
not only of that part of the price of a commodity
which resolves itself into labour, but
of that which resolves itself into rent, and of
that which resolves itself into profit.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> This
is perfectly just; and, in particular, nothing
can be more natural and obvious than to measure
by labour the increase of value which
commodities derive from profits; because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>profits are a per centage upon the advances,
and the main original advances in the great
mass of commodities are the necessary quantity
of labour.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, if a hundred days’ labour be advanced
for a year,<a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> in order to produce a
commodity, and the rate of profits be 10 per
cent., it is impossible in any way to represent
so correctly the increase of value which the
commodity derives from profits as by adding
10 per cent., or whatever may be the rate of
profits, to the quantity of labour actually employed,
and saying, that the completed commodity
when sold would be worth ten days’
labour more than the quantity of labour
worked up in it. On the other hand, if we
were ignorant of the rate of profits, but found
that a hundred days’ labour advanced for a
year would produce a commodity which
would ordinarily sell for the value of one
hundred and ten days, we might safely conclude
that ordinary profits were 10 per cent.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Now, if we were to compare two commodities,
on each of which a hundred days’
labour had been employed, and one of them
could be brought to market immediately,
the other in not less time than a year, it is
quite obvious, that we could not say that
they would exchange with each other according
to the quantity of labour worked up
in them; but we evidently could say, that
they would exchange with each other according
to the quantity of labour <em>and of profits</em>
worked up in them, and that one of them would
be 10 per cent. more valuable than the other,
because profits had added the value of ten
days’ labour to the labour actually employed
upon the one; while there being no profits
in the other, its value was only in proportion
to the labour actually employed upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in general, while the slightest examination
of what is passing around us must
convince us that commodities, under deduction
of rent and taxes, <em>do not</em> ordinarily exchange
with each according to the quantity
of human labour worked up in them, the
same examination will convince us that, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the same deduction, they do ordinarily exchange
with each other, according to the
quantity of human labour <em>and of profits</em> worked
up in them; and further, that the quantity
of human labour worked up in them, with the
profits upon the advances for the time that
they have been advanced, is correctly measured
by the quantity of human labour of the
same kind which the commodity so composed
will ordinarily command.</p>

<p class='c011'>We must carefully, therefore, distinguish
between <em>measuring</em> profits by labour, and
meaning profits by labour; and while the first
is obviously justifiable, and may be in the
highest degree useful, it must be allowed,
that the latter contradicts all the most obvious
rules for the use of terms: it contradicts
the usage of common conversation: it
contradicts the highest authorities in the
science of political economy: it embarrasses
all explanations; and it cannot be maintained
with consistency.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though Mr. Macculloch’s work affords
other instances of a want of attention, on a
point so important in all philosophical discussions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>as appropriate and consistent definitions,
I will only notice further, his use of
the term <em>real</em>. He applies it to wages, in
two senses entirely different.</p>

<p class='c011'>In part iii. p. 294, he says, “But if the
variation in the rate of wages be <em>real</em>, and
not nominal, that is, if the labourer be getting
either a greater or less <em>proportion of the
produce of his industry</em>, or a greater or less
quantity of money of invariable value, this
will not happen.” Here, it is evident that
Mr. Macculloch applies the term <em>real</em> to
wages, in the sense of proportional wages,
that is, as Mr. Ricardo applied it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In part iii. p. 365, Mr. Macculloch says,
“If the productiveness of industry were to
diminish, proportional wages might rise,
notwithstanding that <em>real wages</em>, or the <em>absolute
amount of the produce</em> of industry falling
to the share of the labourer, might be diminished.
Here, the term real wages is
used as synonymous with the absolute amount
of produce falling to the share of the labourer,
that is, in the sense in which Adam
Smith has applied it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>I have already observed, that Adam Smith’s
application of the term <em>real wages</em>, to the
absolute quantity of the produce earned by the
labourer, seems to be a most natural one; and
Mr. Ricardo’s application of the same term
to the <em>proportion</em> of the produce earned by the
labourer, a most unnatural one. Mr. Macculloch,
therefore, was quite right, in introducing
the term <em>proportionate wages</em>, to express
Mr. Ricardo’s meaning; but why not
adhere to it? Why should he, in some places,
mean, by real wages, proportionate wages, and,
in other places, something totally different?</p>

<p class='c011'>In the application of the term <em>real</em> to
value, Mr. Macculloch adopts the meaning
of Mr. Ricardo. He says, indeed, “that it is
to Mr. Ricardo’s sagacity, in distinguishing
between the quantity of labour required to
produce commodities, and the quantity of
labour for which they will exchange, and in
showing, that while the first is undeniably
correct as a measure of their real, and generally
speaking, of their exchangeable values,
the second, instead of being an equivalent
proposition, is frequently opposed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the first, and consequently, quite inaccurate,
that the science is indebted for one of its
greatest improvements.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I should be sorry to think that Mr. Ricardo’s
services to the science of political
economy should rest principally upon the
frail foundation, on which they are here
placed; a foundation, which, as we have
seen, Mr. Macculloch himself cannot defend,
without totally altering the meaning of Mr.
Ricardo’s words.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is evident, in various passages of
Mr. Macculloch’s work. In his section on
value, part ii. p. 216, he thus expresses
himself: “assuming the <em>toil and trouble of acquiring
any thing</em> to be the measure of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>real value, or of the <em>esteem</em> in which it is
held by its possessor.” Again, he says,
p. 219, “the real value of a commodity, or
<em>the estimation in which it is held by its possessor</em>,
is measured or determined by the
quantity of labour required to produce or obtain
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In these two passages, he obviously identifies
the real value of a commodity with
the estimation in which it is held. But,
surely, in this case, the term real must be
applied as Adam Smith applies it, and not
as Mr. Ricardo applies it? Can it be contended
for a moment, that a commodity,
which, on account of the necessary remuneration
for profits, sells for ten per cent. above
the value of the human labour worked up in
it, is not held in <em>higher estimation</em>, than a
commodity which sells for ten per cent. less,
on account of the value of the labour employed
upon it not having been increased by
profits? Would it not be absolutely certain,
that if the latter could be obtained by the
sacrifice of a hundred days’ labour, it would
be necessary to make the sacrifice of a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and ten days’ labour, or some equivalent for
it, in order to obtain the former? Consequently
it follows necessarily, that if the real
value of a commodity be considered as synonymous
with the estimation in which it is
held, such value must be measured by the
quantity of labour which it will command,
and not the quantity worked up in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Macculloch thus states Mr. Ricardo’s
main proposition:<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> “a commodity, produced
by a certain quantity of labour, will, in the
state of the market now supposed, (that is,
when the market is not affected by either real
or artificial monopolies, and when the supply
of commodities is equal to the effectual demand,)
uniformly exchange for, or buy any
other commodity, produced by the same
quantity of labour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, if the term labour be taken in the
sense in which it is used by Mr. Ricardo, the
proposition is contradicted by universal experience.
If, on the other hand, the term
labour be considered as including profits, the
proposition is true; but only because it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>a totally different one from that of Mr. Ricardo,
owing to a most unwarrantable perversion
of terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears, then, on the whole, that although
Mr. Macculloch has at different times
compared Adam Smith to Newton and to
Locke, he has, in the definition and application
of his terms, differed from him on
almost all the most important subjects of
Political Economy,—in the definition of
wealth, the definition of capital, the definition
of productive and unproductive labour, the
definition of profits, the definition of labour
simply, and the definition of <em>real value</em>, though,
in the last instance, it is rather professedly
than substantially.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>However highly I may respect the authority
of Adam Smith, and however inconvenient
at first a great change of terms and
meanings must necessarily be, yet if it could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>be made out that such changes would essentially
facilitate the explanation and improvement
of the science of political economy, I
should have been the last to oppose them.
But after considering them with much attention,
I own I feel the strongest conviction that
they are eminently the reverse of being <em>useful</em>,
with a view to an explanation of the <em>nature
and causes of the wealth of nations</em>; or, in
more modern, though not more appropriate
phrase, the <em>production, distribution, and consumption
of wealth</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have too much respect for Mr. Macculloch to
suppose that he has differed from Adam Smith
on so many points with the intention of giving
to his work a greater air of originality. This
is, no doubt, a feeling which not unfrequently
operates in favour of changes; but I do not
think it did on the present occasion. I should
rather suppose that he adopted them in consequence
of seeing some objections to Adam
Smith’s definitions, without being sufficiently
aware that, in the less strict sciences, nothing
is so easy as to find some objection to a definition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and nothing so difficult as to substitute
an unobjectionable one in its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether the definitions substituted for
those of Adam Smith on the present occasion
have removed the objections to them which
Mr. Macculloch may have felt, I cannot be a
competent judge; but even supposing them
to have done this, I think I can confidently
affirm that they have left other objections,
beyond all comparison greater and more embarrassing.
And on this point I would beg
those of my readers who are inclined to pay
attention to these subjects, seriously and candidly
to trace the consequences to the science
of political economy, in regard to its explanation
and practical application, of adopting
Mr. Macculloch’s definitions. They are not,
indeed, all his own; but the very extraordinary
extension which he has given to the
term capital, the making of no distinction between
directly productive consumption and
consumption that is only indirectly productive;
and the extension of the term labour,
without any adjunct, to mean profits, fermentation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and vegetation, belong, I believe,
exclusively to Mr. Macculloch; and, I think,
it will be found that they are beyond the rest
strikingly calculated to introduce uncertainty
and confusion into the science.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tendency of some of our most popular
writers to innovate without improving, and
their marked inattention to facts, leading necessarily
to differences of opinion and uncertainty
of conclusion, have been the main
causes which have of late thrown some
discredit on the science of political economy.
Nor can this be a matter of much surprise,
though it may be of regret.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a period, when all the merchants of our
own country, and many in others, find the
utmost difficulty in employing their capitals so
as to obtain ordinary profits, they are repeatedly
told that, according to the principles of
political economy, no difficulty can ever be
found in employing capital, if it be laid out in
the production of the proper articles; and
that any distress which they may have suffered
is exclusively owing to a wrong application
of their capital, such as “the production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of cottons, which were not wanted, instead of
broad cloths, which were wanted.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> They
are, further, gravely assured, that if they find
any difficulty in exchanging what they have
produced, for what they wish to obtain for
it, “they have an obvious resource at hand;
they can abandon the production of the commodities
which they do not want, and apply
themselves directly to the production of those
that they <em>do</em> want, or of substitutes for them;”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
and this consolatory recommendation is perhaps
addressed to a merchant who is desirous
of obtaining, by the employment of his capital
at the ordinary rate of profits, such an income
as will enable him to get a governess for his
daughters, and to send his boys to school and
college.</p>

<p class='c011'>At such times, assertions like these, and
the proposal of such a remedy, appear to
me little different from an assertion, on supposed
philosophical principles, that it <em>cannot</em>
rain, when crowds of people are getting wet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>through, and the proposal to go without
clothes in order to prevent the inconvenience
arising from a wet coat. If assertions so
contrary to the most glaring facts, and remedies
so preposterously ridiculous, in a civilized
country,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> are said to be dictated by the principles
of political economy, it cannot be
matter of wonder that many have little faith
in them. And till the theories of popular
writers on political economy cease to be in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>direct opposition to general experience; and
till some steadiness is given to the science by
a greater degree of care among its professors,
not to alter without improving,—it cannot be
expected that it should attain that general
influence in society which (its principles being
just) would be of the highest practical utility.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII.</span><br /> <span class='large'>ON THE DEFINITION AND USE OF TERMS BY THE AUTHOR OF “A CRITICAL DISSERTATION ON THE NATURE, MEASURE, AND CAUSES OF VALUE.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It might be thought that I was not called
upon to notice the deviations from the most
obvious rules for the use of terms in a <cite>Critical
Dissertation on the Nature, Measure, and
Causes of Value</cite>, by an anonymous writer.
But the great importance of the subject itself
at the present moment, when it may be said
to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub judice</span></i>, the tone of scientific precision
in which the dissertation is written, notwithstanding
its fundamental errors, and the
impression which it is understood to have
made among some considerable political
economists, seem to call for and justify attention
to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author, in his preface, observes, that
“Writers on political economy have generally
contented themselves with a short definition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of the term value, and a distinction of
the property denoted by it into several kinds,
and have then proceeded to employ the word
with various degrees of laxity. Not one of
them has brought into distinct view the
nature of the idea represented by this term,
or the inferences which a full perception of
its meaning immediately suggests; and the
neglect of this preliminary has created differences
of opinion and perplexities of thought
which otherwise could never have existed.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now it appears to me, that the author, at
his first setting out, has in an eminent degree
fallen into the very errors which he has here
animadverted upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>He begins by stating, very justly, that
“value, in its ultimate sense, appears to
mean the esteem in which any object is held;”
and then proceeds to state, in the most lax
and inconsequent manner, that “It is only
when objects are considered together as subjects
of preference or exchange that the
specific feeling of value can arise. When
they are so considered, our esteem for one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>object, or our wish to possess it, may be equal
to, or greater, or less than our esteem for
another; <em>it may, for instance, be doubly as
great</em>, or, in other words, we would give one
of the former for two of the latter. So long
as we regarded objects singly, we might feel
a great degree of admiration or fondness for
them, but we could not express our emotions
in any definite manner. When, however,
we regard two objects, as subjects of choice
or exchange, we appear to acquire the power
of expressing our feelings with precision; we
say, for instance, that one <em>a</em> is, in our estimation,
equal to two <em>b</em>.... The value of <em>a</em> is
expressed by the quantity <em>b</em>, for which it will
exchange, and the value of <em>b</em> is, in the same
way, expressed by the quantity of <em>a</em>.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>So, then, it appears, as a consequence of
value, meaning the esteem in which an object
is held, that if there were two sorts of fruit
in a country, called <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, both very plentiful
in the summer, and both very scarce in
the winter; and if in both seasons they were
to bear the same relation to each other, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>feelings of the inhabitants with regard to the
fruit <em>a</em> would be <em>expressed with precision</em>, by
saying that, as it would always command the
same quantity of the fruit <em>b</em>, it would continue
to be of the same value—that is, would
be held in the same estimation in summer as
in winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears, further, that in a country where
there were only deer, and no beavers or other
products to compare them with, the specific
feeling of value for deer could not arise among
the inhabitants; although, on account of the
high esteem in which they were held, any
man would willingly walk fifty miles in order
to get one!! These are, to be sure, very
strange conclusions, but they follow directly
from the previous statements.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author, however, nothing daunted,
goes on to say, that “If from any consideration,
or number of considerations, men esteem
one <em>a</em> as highly as two <em>b</em>, and are willing to
exchange the two commodities in that ratio,
it may be correctly said that <em>a</em> has the power
of commanding two <em>b</em>, or that <em>b</em> has the power
of commanding half of <em>a</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“The definition of Adam Smith, therefore,
that the value of an object expresses the
power of purchasing other goods which the
possession of that object conveys, is substantially
correct; and as it is plain and intelligible,
it may be taken as the basis of our subsequent
reasonings without any further metaphysical
investigation.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In a Critical Dissertation on Value, which
is introduced with a heavy complaint against
all preceding political economists for neglecting
the preliminary labour necessary to give
a full perception of its meaning, it might
naturally have been expected, that previous
to the final adoption of the meaning in which
it was intended to use the term, throughout
the dissertation, the consideration, or number
of considerations, which induce men to prefer
one object to another, or to give two <em>b</em> for
one <em>a</em>, should be carefully investigated. But
nothing of this kind is done. A definition of
the value of an object by Adam Smith, which,
as he afterwards clearly shows, requires
explanation and modification, is arbitrarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>adopted, or, in the language of the author,
is “taken as the basis of his subsequent
reasonings, without any further metaphysical
investigation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That this first general description of value
in exchange by Adam Smith does not, without
further explanation, convey to the reader
the prevailing meaning which he himself
attaches to the term, is obvious in many passages
of his work, and particularly in his
elaborate inquiry into the value of silver
during the four last centuries. He there
shows, in the most satisfactory manner, that,
in the progress of cultivation and improvement,
there is a class of commodities, such as
cattle, wood, pigs, poultry, &amp;c., which, on account
of their becoming comparatively more
scarce and difficult of attainment, necessarily
rise in value; yet he particularly states, that
this rise in their value is not connected with
any degradation in the value of silver,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
although it is obvious that, other things being
the same, a pound of silver would have a
smaller power of purchasing other goods.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Nothing, indeed, can be clearer than that
this general description of value requires further
explanation. There is the greatest difference
imaginable between an increased
power in any object of purchasing other goods,
arising from its scarcity and the increased
difficulty of procuring it; and the increase
of its power to purchase other goods arising
from the increased plenty of such goods and
the increased facility of procuring them. Nor
is it easy to conceive any distinction more
vital to the subject of <em>value</em>, as the term is
generally understood, or more necessary to
“a full perception of its meaning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I cannot but think, therefore, that the author,
under all the circumstances of the case,
was not justified in adopting this definition of
Adam Smith without further investigation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the adoption of this definition by the
author in so unceremonious a manner, though
quite inconsistent with the declarations in the
preface, and most unpromising in regard to
any improvement of the science which might
have been expected from the dissertation, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>by no means the gravest offence which he has
committed in the opening of his subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adam Smith’s definition, taken as it stands,
however imperfect it may be, would still
serve as a rough but useful standard of value
in those cases where, in using the most ordinary
forms of expression, some kind of standard
is tacitly referred to, and no other more accurate
one had been adopted.</p>

<p class='c011'>But how is this definition of Adam Smith
to be interpreted? If we understand it in
the sense usually conveyed by the terms employed,
it is impossible to doubt that by the
power of purchasing other goods is meant the
power of purchasing other goods generally.
Who, then, could have conceived before-hand
that the author would have inferred from this
definition that he was justified in representing
the power of purchasing other goods by the
power of purchasing any one sort of goods
which might first come to hand?—so that,
considering the value of money in this country
to be proportioned to its general power of
purchasing, it would be correct to say that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the value of an ounce of silver was proportioned
to the quantity of apples which it would
command; and that when it commanded more
apples, the value of silver rose—when it commanded
fewer apples, the value of silver fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is, no doubt, quite allowable to compare
any two commodities whatever together in
regard to their value in exchange, and,
among others, silver and apples. It is also
allowable to say, though it would in general
sound very strange, that the value of an ounce
of silver, <em>estimated in apples</em>, is the quantity
of apples it will command, provided that, by
thus using the qualifying expression <em>estimated
in apples</em>, immediately after the word value,
we distinctly give notice to the reader that we
are not going to speak of the exchangeable
value of silver generally, according to the
definition of Adam Smith, but merely in the
very confined sense of its relation to one particular
article. But if, without this distinct
notice to the reader, we simply say that the
value of an ounce of silver is expressed by
the quantity of apples for which it will exchange,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>or, in the words of the author, that
“the value of <em>a</em> is expressed by the quantity
of <em>b</em>, for which it will exchange,” nothing can
be more clear than that we use the term value
in a manner totally unwarranted by the previous
definition, that is, in a sense quite distinct
from that in which Adam Smith uses it
in the description of value adopted by the
author.</p>

<p class='c011'>Putting the corn and the circulating medium
of a country out of the question, the
relations of which to labour and the costs
of producing various commodities are tolerably
well known, I think no one, in ordinary
conversation, has ever been heard to express
the general power of purchasing by the power
of purchasing some one particular commodity.
I certainly, at least, myself never recollect to
have heard these two very distinct meanings
confounded. It would, indeed, sound very
strange, if a person returning from India, on
being asked what was the value of money in
that country, were to mention the quantity of
English broad cloth which a given quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of money would exchange for, and to infer,
in consequence, that the value of money was
lower in India than in England.</p>

<p class='c011'>In regard to the opinions and practice of
other writers on political economy, most of
them have considered the general power of
purchasing, and the power of purchasing
a particular commodity as so essentially
distinct, that they have given them different
names. The only authority quoted
with approbation by the author, is Colonel
Torrens, whose views, as to the nature of
value, appear to him, he says, to be sounder
than those of any other writer. Yet, what
does Colonel Torrens say on this subject?—“The
term exchangeable value expresses the
power of purchasing with respect to commodities
in general. The term price denotes
the same power with respect to some particular
commodity, the quantity of which is
given. Thus, when I speak of the <em>exchangeable
value</em> of cotton as rising or falling, I
imply, that it will purchase a greater or less
quantity of corn, and wine, and labour, and
other marketable commodities; but when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>talk of the <em>price</em> of cotton as rising or falling,
I mean, that it will purchase a greater or less
quantity of some one particular commodity,
such as corn, or wine, or labour, or money,
which is either expressed or understood. Exchangeable
value may rise, while price falls, or
fall while price rises. For example; if cotton
were, from any cause, to acquire twice its former
power of purchasing, with respect to goods in
general, while gold, the particular commodity
in which the price of cotton is expressed, rose
in a still higher ratio, and acquired four times
its former power in the market, then, though
the exchangeable value of cotton would be
doubled, its price would fall one half. Again;
if cotton would purchase only half the former
quantity of commodities, while it purchased
twice the quantity of some particular commodity,
such as corn, or wine, or labour, or
money, then its exchangeable value would
have sunk one half, while its price, as expressed
in corn, or wine, or labour, or money,
became double. And again; if cotton, and
the particular commodity in which price is
expressed, should rise or fall in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>proportion with each other, then the exchangeable
value of cotton, or its general
power of purchasing, would fluctuate, while
its price remained stationary.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It appears then, that, whether Colonel Torrens’s
view of value be quite correct or not, he
draws the most marked line of distinction possible
between the power of purchasing generally,
and the power of purchasing a particular
commodity, and is decidedly of opinion, that
the latter, which is the sense in which the author
uses the term value, should not be called
value, but price. The authority of Colonel
Torrens, therefore, whose views on the subject
of value the author considers as so sound,
is directly against him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But not only does Colonel Torrens attach
a very different meaning to the term value,
from that in which it is used by the author
throughout the greatest part of his work, but
the author himself, in his notes and illustrations,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
has given extracts from almost all the
distinguished writers in political economy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>expressly for the purpose of showing the
universality of an opinion respecting the nature
and measure of value directly opposed
to his own. The writers to whom he refers,
are Adam Smith, Sir James Stuart, Lord
Lauderdale, M. Storch, M. Say, Mr. Ricardo,
myself, Colonel Torrens, Mrs. Marcet, Mr.
Mill, the Templar’s Dialogues, and Mr. Blake.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the case of a proposition the nature of
which admits of a logical proof, authority is
of no consequence; but in a question which
relates to the meaning to be attached to a
particular term, it is quite incredible that
any person should thus have ventured to disregard
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Much, however, of inconsistency, of illogical
inference, and disregard of authority, might
have been forgiven, if the proposed change
in the meaning of the term value would introduce
a much greater degree of clearness
and precision into the language of political
economy, and, in that way, be eminently
useful to the progress of the science.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, what would be the consequence of
adopting the meaning which the author attaches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to the term value, and of allowing,
according to his own words, that “the value
of <em>a</em> is expressed by the quantity of <em>b</em> for
which it will exchange, and the value of <em>b</em> is,
in the same way, expressed by the quantity of
<em>a</em>?”<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> One of these consequences is strikingly
described in the following passage of the
author’s chapter on <cite>Real and Nominal Value</cite>,
a distinction which he is pleased to call
unmeaning. “The value of a commodity
denoting its relation in exchange to some
other commodity, we may speak of it as
money-value, corn-value, cloth-value, according
to the commodity with which it is compared:
and hence there are a thousand
different kinds of value, as many kinds of
value as there are commodities in existence,
and all are equally real and equally nominal.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This is precision with a vengeance. Now,
though I am very far from intending to say
that the writers on political economy have
been sufficiently agreed as to the precise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>meaning which they attach to the terms <em>value
of a commodity</em>, when no express reference is
made to the object with which it is to be compared,
yet, by drawing a marked line of distinction
between what has been called the
real value of commodities and their nominal
value, or, more correctly, between their
<em>value</em> and their <em>price</em>, they have avoided the
prodigious confusion which would arise from
a commodity having a thousand or ten thousand
different values at the same time. Whenever
they use the term value of a commodity
alone, and speak of its rising or falling, if they
do not mean money-price, they refer either
to its power of purchasing generally, or to
something expressive of its elementary cost
of production.</p>

<p class='c011'>In either case, some general and very
important information is communicated; but
the value of a commodity, in the sense understood
by the author, might be expressed
a hundred different ways, without conveying
a rational answer to any person who had inquired
about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further; the use of the term <em>value</em>, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>sense understood by the author, is entirely superfluous.
It has exactly the same meaning as
the term <em>price</em>, except that the term price has
this very decided advantage over it, namely,
that when the price of a commodity is mentioned,
without an express reference to any
other object in which it is to be estimated,
political economists have universally agreed
to understand it as referring to money. This
is a prodigious advantage in favour of the
term price, and tends greatly to promote both
facility and precision in the language of political
economy. When I ask, what is the
<em>price</em> of wheat in Poland? no one has the least
doubt about my meaning, and I should, without
fail, get the kind of answer I intended. But if I
asked, what was the <em>value</em> of wheat in Poland?
I might, according to the author, be answered
in a thousand different ways, all equally proper,
and yet not one of the answers be of the
kind I wanted. Of course, whether I use the
term value or price, if I always expressly subjoin
the object to which I mean to refer, it will
be quite indifferent to which term I resort.
But it is vain to suppose that the public will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>submit to such constant and unnecessary circumlocution.
It would quite alter the language
of political economy; and the kind of
abbreviation which has taken place in application
to the term price could not take place
in regard to value, according to the doctrines
of the author; because, when the <em>value</em>
of a commodity is used alone, like the price of
a commodity, no one object rather than another
is entitled to a preference for the expression
of that value. The author says distinctly in
a note,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> that money-value has no greater
claim to the general term <em>value</em> than any other
kind of value. It is quite clear, therefore,
that if the term value is only to be applied in
the sense in which it is applied by the author,
it would be much better to exclude it at once
from the vocabulary of political economy as
utterly useless, and only calculated to produce
confusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be further observed, that the sense
in which the author proposes to apply the
term value, is so different from the sense in
which it is understood in ordinary conversation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and among the best writers, that it
would be quite impossible to maintain it with
consistency. The author himself, however
obstinately, at times, he seems to persevere
in the peculiar meaning which he has given
to the term value, frequently uses it by itself,
without reference to any particular article in
which he proposes to express it. Even in
the titles of some of his chapters he does this;
and when in Chapter <span class='fss'>XI.</span> he discusses <em>the distinction
between value and riches</em>, and in Chapter
<span class='fss'>XI.</span> <em>the causes of value</em>, we are entitled to
complain, that he has not acted according to
the instructions which he has given to others,
and told us, either expressly, or by implication,
in what article the value here mentioned
is to be expressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again; when he mentions the value of that
corn which is produced on lands paying
rent, and when he speaks, as he frequently
does, of the value of capital,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a> he does not tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>us in what he means to express the value of
corn, or of capital, although he thinks that
such a reference, either expressed or implied,
is always necessary, and particularly
says, “In the preceding pages it has been
shown, that we can express the value of
a commodity only by the quantity of some
other commodity for which it will exchange.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The meaning, therefore, which he gives to
the term value is such, that he cannot and
does not maintain it consistently himself,
much less can he expect that others should
so maintain it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears, then, that the author has arbitrarily
adopted a meaning of the term
value quite unwarranted by the usage of
ordinary conversation, directly opposed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>authority of the best writers on political economy,
pre-eminently and conspicuously useless;
and of such a nature that it cannot be
maintained with consistency.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what does he do with his definition
after so adopting it?</p>

<p class='c011'>He applies it to try the truth of a number
of propositions advanced by different writers,
who, according to his own showing, have
used the term in a very different sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, I own, appears to me much the same
kind of proceeding as if a person were to
define a straight line to be something essentially
different from a line lying evenly between
its two extremes, and then were gravely
to apply it to one proposition after another
of Euclid, and show, as might easily be done,
granting the definition, that the conclusions
of the Grecian geometer were all wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>The perseverance with which the author
proceeds gravely to apply his peculiar definition
of value to other writers, who have
defined it differently, is truly curious, and must
be allowed to be a great waste of time and
labour. If, as he says he has repeatedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>stated, “to know the value of an article at
any period is merely to know its relation in
exchange to some other commodity;”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a> and
if, as I believe, no previous writer, in referring
to the value of an article at any period
ever thought or said that it could be expressed
by its relation in exchange to any
other contemporary commodity indifferently,
it might at once be presumed, without further
trouble, that almost all former propositions
involving the term value would turn out to be
either false or futile. It was quite unnecessary
for him, therefore, to go into the detail;
but as he has done so, it may be useful to follow
him in some of his conclusions, as it may
assist in drawing attention to a subject which
lies at the bottom of many of the difficulties
in political economy, and has not been sufficiently
considered.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the first effects of the author’s definition
is to destroy the distinction between
what many writers of great authority have
called <em>real value</em>, and <em>nominal value</em>. I have
already had occasion to observe, that Adam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Smith, by applying the term <em>real</em> wages to
express the necessaries and conveniencies of
life earned by the labourer, had precluded
himself from the power of applying it consistently
to the <em>value</em> of a commodity, in order
to express its power of commanding labour;
because it is well known that the same quantity
of labour will both produce and command,
at different times and under different circumstances,
a very different quantity of the necessaries
and conveniencies of life. But putting
aside for the present this acknowledged inconsistency
of Adam Smith, and taking real value
as distinguished from nominal in the sense in
which the writers who have so applied it
intended, the author’s observations on these
writers are not a little extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c011'>After noticing the doctrines of Adam Smith,
Mr. Ricardo, and myself, on the subject of
real and nominal value, he says, “After the
disquisition on the nature of value in the preceding
chapter, the distinction of it in this way
must appear to be merely arbitrary and incapable
of being turned to any use. What information
is conveyed or what advance in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>argument is effected, by telling us that value
estimated in one way is real, but in another,
is nominal?”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> He afterwards goes on to say,
in reference to a passage in the Templar’s
Dialogues, “It would not, however, probably
have been written, had the author attended
to the simple fact, that value must always
imply value in something, and unless that
something is indicated, the word conveys no
information. Now, as the terms nominal and
real do not denote anything in this way, they
convey no precise information, and are liable
to engender continual disputes, because their
meaning is arbitrarily assumed.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>These appear to me, I confess, to be very
extraordinary observations. It must surely
be allowed, that to compare a commodity
either with the mass of other commodities, or
with the elementary costs of production, is
most essentially distinct from comparing it
with some particular commodity named. And
if so, writers are bound so to express themselves
as to convey to their readers, which of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the two they intend to refer to. Whether
these writers have chosen the very best terms
to express these ideas is another question;
but that the ideas themselves are quite different,
and that it is essential to the language
of political economy that they should be distinguished
by different terms, cannot admit
of a doubt. It appears to me, therefore,
almost inconceivable that the author should
say, “What information is conveyed, or what
advance in argument is effected, by telling us,
that value estimated in one way is real, but
in another, is nominal?” It might as well
be said, that, in speaking of our planetary
system, no information is conveyed by using
different adjuncts to the term distance, in
order to distinguish between the distances
of the planets from the sun, and the relations
of their distances to each other. And supposing
it had been the habit of most writers
to call the first distances real and the second
relative, would it not be most strange to say
that the distinction in this way of distance
into two kinds is incapable of being turned to
any use, as all distance is relative?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>The author is repeatedly dwelling upon the
relative nature of value, as if he alone had
considered it in this light; but no other writer
that I have met with has ever appeared to
me to use the term value without an intelligible
reference expressed or implied to something
else; and when the author says, in the
passage above quoted, that value must always
imply value in something which ought to be
indicated, and that the terms nominal and
real do not denote anything in this way, he
appears to me, I own, to assert what is
entirely without foundation. M. Say, for
instance, in a passage quoted by the author
in his notes,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> observes, “There is this difference
between a real and a relative variation
of price; that the former is a change of
value arising from an alteration of the changes
of production; the latter a change arising
from an alteration in the ratio of value of one
particular commodity to other commodities.”
Now is it possible to say with truth, that the
real and relative values here described do not
both refer to other objects, and that these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>objects are not so different as to require to
be distinguished?</p>

<p class='c011'>The author may, perhaps, say, that if both
expressions are meant to be relative, why use
the terms real, positive, or absolute? The
answer is, that the usage of our language
allows it, and that nothing is more common
than the use of the terms real, positive, and
absolute, in contradistinction to relative, when
the former terms have relation to some more
general object, particularly to anything which
is considered as a standard, whether accurate
or inaccurate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, in the illustration before adverted to,
although all distances are relative, it would be
quite justifiable to say, that if the earth was
moving towards the farthest part of her orbit,
her positive, absolute, or real distance from
the sun was increasing, although her distance
relatively to that of some other planet or
comet, moving from the sun with greater velocity,
was diminishing. Tall and short, rich
and poor, are relative terms: yet surely we
should be warranted in saying, that Peter was
not only taller than his three brothers, but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>really or positively, a tall man. In the first
case he is said to be tall in relation to three
individuals; but a stranger, knowing nothing
of the height of these individuals, would obtain
very little information from the statement.
He would not know whether Peter was four
feet, five feet, or six feet high: in the latter
case, Peter is said to be tall in relation to the
average or standard height of the race of men
spoken of; and though the stranger might
not have in his mind a perfectly accurate notion
of this standard, yet he would immediately
have before him the height of Peter within
a few inches, instead of a few feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the same principle, would it not be
most ridiculous for any person gravely to propose
that as rich and poor are relative terms,
no one should ever call a man rich without
mentioning at the same time the individual in
relation to whom he was rich? It is perfectly
well known, that when, in any particular place
or country, a man is said to be a rich man, the
term refers to a sort of loose standard, expressing
either a certain command over the goods
of this life, or a certain superiority in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>respect over the mass of the society, which
superiority it had been the custom to mark by
this expression. In either case, it would be
allowable to call the man really or positively
rich. But if the proposed change were
adopted, and instead of saying that Mr. John
Doe was a rich man, we could only say that
he was rich in relation to Mr. Richard Roe,
as poor Richard might be little better than a
pauper, Mr. Doe might, after all, be in very
narrow circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is clear, therefore, not only that the terms
real and positive may be legitimately applied
in contradistinction to relative, when a relation
to some more general object or standard
is intended; but that the difference between
the two sorts of relations is of the utmost
importance, and ought to be carefully distinguished.
It is not easy to conceive, therefore,
how any writer could suppose that the language
of political economy would be improved
by a definition which would destroy
this distinction, and make as many kinds of
value as there are commodities, all equally
real and equally nominal. In reference to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>all other political economists, whenever they
have used the term value of a commodity,
without specifically mentioning the object in
which they intended to estimate it, I have
always felt myself authorised, consistently
with their general language, to consider them
as referring tacitly either to the mass of commodities,
to the state of the supply compared
with the demand, or to the elementary costs
of production. But when the author of the
Critical Dissertation uses the term value,
which he does frequently without specific application,
his general doctrine must leave the
reader quite at a loss to conjecture what he
means.</p>

<p class='c011'>Proceeding on the same strange misapprehension
or perversion of the language of
other writers, the author says of the writer of
the Templar’s Dialogues, “Following Mr. Ricardo,
he appears entirely to lose sight of the
relative nature of value, and, as I have remarked
in the preceding chapter, to consider
it as something positive and absolute; so that
if there were only two commodities in the
world, and they should both, by some circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>or other, come to be produced by
double the usual quantity of labour, they
would both rise in real value, although their
relation to each other would be undisturbed.
According to this doctrine every thing might
at once become more valuable by requiring at
once more labour for its production; a position
utterly at variance with the truth, that
value denotes the relation in which commodities
stand to each other as articles of exchange.
Real value, in a word, is on this
theory considered as the independent result
of labour; and, consequently, if under any
circumstances the quantity of labour is increased,
the real value is increased. Hence
the paradox, that it is impossible for <em>a</em> continually
to increase in value—in real value
observe, and yet command a continually decreasing
quantity of <em>b</em>, and this although they
were the only two commodities in existence.
For it must not be supposed that the author
means that <em>a</em> might increase in value in
relation to a third commodity <em>c</em>, while it
commanded a decreasing quantity of <em>b</em>; a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>proposition which is too self-evident to be
insisted on; but he means that <em>a</em> might
increase in a kind of value called real, which
has no reference to any other commodity
whatever.” Apply to the position of this
author the rule recommended in the last
chapter; inquire, when he speaks of value,
value in what? and all the possible truth on
the subject appears in its naked simplicity.
He adds afterwards again, “value must be
value in something, or in relation to something.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Now let the reader recollect that this passage
was written by a person who sets out
with saying that value in its ultimate sense
appears to mean the esteem in which any
object is held, and it will appear most remarkable.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, what can the author possibly
mean by speaking of the kind of value
here called <em>real</em>, as if it had no relation to any
thing else? The Templar, it must surely be
allowed, has explained himself with sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>clearness that by real value he means value in
relation to the producing labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, I would ask the writer, who says
that the value of a commodity means the
esteem in which it is held, whether the labour
required to produce a commodity does not,
beyond all comparison, express more nearly
the esteem in which the commodity is held,
than a reference to some other commodity the
producing labour of which is utterly unknown,
and may therefore be one day or one thousand
days?</p>

<p class='c011'>I have already stated that I decidedly
differ from Mr. Ricardo, and it follows of
course that I differ equally from the Templar,
in thinking that the value of a commodity
may be correctly expressed by referring to the
producing labour alone; but compared with
the expression of value proposed to be substituted
by the author of the Critical Dissertation,
it has a prodigious superiority. Let us
try both, for instance, by the touch of the
talisman recommended by the author himself.
Let the question be the value of silver before
the discovery of the American mines; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>let us ask, as directed, value in relation to
what? The Templar would answer, value in
relation to the producing labour; and though
in this answer a material ingredient of elementary
value is omitted, yet I should collect
from it some tolerable notion of the esteem in
which silver was held at that time; and if I
found, on comparison, that the producing
labour was now three or four times less,
I should be able, with tolerable certainty,
to infer, that silver had grown more plentiful;
and that four centuries ago a given
quantity of silver was held in much greater
esteem, that is, people would make a much
greater sacrifice in order to obtain it, than at
present.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand, if the author of the
Critical Dissertation should speak of the value
of silver before the discovery of the American
mines, and we should ask, value in relation
to what? the answer would be, “I have repeatedly
stated that to know the value of an
article at any period is merely to know its
relation in exchange to some other commodity;”
consequently, we should know the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>value of silver in the fifteenth century, or the
esteem in which it was held, by comparing
it with calicoes, although we might know
nothing at all about the difficulty or facility
of obtaining calicoes at that time. And if we
were to proceed, as in the former case, and,
with a view to ascertain the esteem in which
silver was held in the fifteenth century, as
compared with the esteem in which it is
held in the nineteenth, were to mark the relation
of silver to calicoes in the two periods,
it would appear, that as, owing to the improvements
in the cotton machinery, a given
quantity of silver would command more calicoes
now than formerly, silver should be
considered as being held in higher estimation
now than four centuries ago. Yet no person,
I believe, not even the author himself, would
agree to this conclusion. He would probably
say that the comparison was merely
between silver and calicoes, and had nothing
to do with anything else. If this be all he
means, why does he confuse his readers by
stating that value means the esteem in which
a commodity is held? and why does he say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>that to know the value of an article at any
period is merely to know its relation in exchange
to some other commodity? If all he
means by the value of a commodity is its relation
to some other, why did he not at once
say, without ever talking about esteem, that
the value of one commodity in relation to
any other was expressed by the quantity of
that other for which the first would exchange;
and that, when the first rose in relation to the
other, the other would always fall proportionably
in relation to the first? If he had so
expressed himself, his proposition would have
obtained universal consent; it would have
been a truism which had never been denied.
But as long as he continues to talk of the
esteem in which commodities are held, his
readers must consider him as peculiarly
inconsistent, if, on the supposition of there
being only two commodities in existence, he
prefers measuring the esteem in which one
of them is held by its relation to the other,
rather than by its relation to the producing
labour. And they must further think, that
while he continues to state that “to know the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>value of an article at any period is merely to
know its relation in exchange to some other
commodity,” he is stating a proposition which,
according to the usual sense in which the
word value is understood when so placed, is
totally unfounded. No man, I believe, but the
author would venture to say that he should
know the value of silver four hundred years
ago by knowing the quantity of calicoes which
an ounce of silver would then command.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sixth chapter of the author is entitled
“On Measures of Value;” and the discussion
of this subject leads him to such strange conclusions,
that one cannot but feel the greatest
surprise at his not seeing that he must have
been proceeding in a wrong course. He ridicules
the notion of its being necessary that
a commodity should possess invariable value,
in order to form a perfect measure of value.
Such a notion, which he says in a note has
been entertained by all the most distinguished
writers in political economy, he civilly calls
an utter absurdity. According to the doctrines
and language of the author, no relation
exists between the value of a commodity at one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>time and the value of the same sort of commodity
at another; and “the only use of a
measure of value, in the sense of a medium
of comparison, is between commodities existing
at the same time.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“If this be so, it is, no doubt, quite absurd
in political economists to look for anything
approaching towards an invariable measure
of value, or even to talk of one commodity or
object being more steady or constant in its
value than another. At the same moment,
bags of hops are as good a measure of the
relative value of commodities as labour or
money. With regard to money, indeed, the
author particularly observes, that from the
relations between corn and money, at two
different periods, no other relation can be deduced;
we do not advance a step beyond
the information given.&nbsp;*&thinsp;* We cannot deduce
the relation of value between corn at the
first, and corn at the second period, because
no such relation exists, nor, consequently,
can we ascertain their comparative power
over other commodities. If we made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>attempt, it would be, in fact, endeavouring to
infer the quantities of corn which exchanged
for each other at two different periods of time,
a thing obviously absurd. And further,
money would not be here discharging a particular
function any more than the other commodity.
We should have the value of corn
in money and the value of money in corn, but
one would be no more a measure or medium
of comparison than the other.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>From all this it follows necessarily that we
must on no account say, that butter has been
rising during the last month; if we do, we
shall be convicted of the absurdity of proposing
to exchange the butter which was consumed
three weeks ago with the butter now
on our table, in order to ascertain that a
pound of the former will command less than a
pound of the latter. For the same reason,
we must not on any account say, that the
value of wheat fell very greatly from 1818 to
1822, and rose considerably from 1822 to
1826. We must not venture to compare
the value of the advances of a master manufacturer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>with the value of his returns; or, in
estimating the rate of his profits, presume
to prefer money, which generally changes
slowly and inconsiderably in its power of
setting labour to work, to hops, which change
so rapidly and greatly, &amp;c. &amp;c. In short,
the whole of the language and inferences of
the business of buying and selling, and making
money, must be altered and adapted to
the new definitions and doctrines.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is quite astonishing that these consequences
should not have startled the author,
and made him turn back. If he had but
adhered to his first description of value,
namely, the esteem in which an object is
held; or even if he had interpreted his second
definition of value, namely, “the power
of purchasing other goods,” according to the
ordinary and natural meaning of the expression,
he could never have been led into the
strange mistake of supposing, that when people
have talked of the value of a commodity
at one period, compared with the value of the
same kind of commodity at another, they could
only refer to the rate at which they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>actually exchange with each other, which, as
no exchange could in such a case take place,
would be absurd. What then did they mean?
They obviously meant either to compare the
esteem in which a commodity was held at one
period with the esteem in which it was held
at another, founded on the state of its supply
compared with the demand, and ordinarily on
its costs of production; or to compare the
general power of purchasing which a commodity
possessed at one period with its general
power of purchasing at another period. And
will the author venture to assert, that there
are not some objects better calculated than
others to measure this esteem, or measure
this general power of purchasing at different
periods? Will the author maintain, that if,
in reference to two periods in the same country,
a commodity of a given kind will in the
second period command double the quantity
of labour that it did in the first, we could
not with much more certainty infer that the
esteem for it had greatly increased, than if
we had taken calicoes or currants as the medium
of comparison? Or would the author,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>upon a little reflection, repeat again what he
says in the passage last quoted, that from the
relations between corn and money in two
successive seasons, we can deduce no other
relation,&nbsp;*&thinsp;* “money would not be here
discharging a particular function any more
than the other commodity. We should have
the value of corn in money and the value of
money in corn, but one would be no more a
measure or medium of comparison than the
other.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>To me, at least, these statements appear
utterly unfounded. If the money-price of
corn has risen this year to double what it was
in the last, I can infer, with almost absolute
certainty, that corn is held in much higher
estimation than it was. I can be quite sure
that the relation of corn to other articles, besides
money, has most essentially changed,
and that a quarter of corn will now command
a much greater quantity of labour, a much
greater quantity of cloth, a much greater
quantity of hardware, a much greater quantity
of hats and shoes, than it did the year before:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>in short, that it will command nearly double
the quantity of all other commodities which
are in their natural and ordinary state, and
have not been essentially affected by the
causes which have operated upon the price
of corn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where then is the truth of saying, that from
the altered relation between corn and money
we deduce no other relation? It is perfectly
obvious that we <em>can</em> deduce and <em>do</em> deduce a
great number of other most important relations;
and, in fact, <em>do</em> ascertain, though not
with perfect accuracy, yet with a most desirable
and useful approach to it, the degree of
increase in the power of corn to command in
exchange the mass of other commodities.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand, from the diminished
power of money in relation to corn, we <em>cannot</em>
infer that money has fallen nearly in the same
proportion in relation to other commodities.
If an ounce of silver will now command only
half a bushel of wheat, instead of a whole
bushel, we can by no means infer that an
ounce of silver will therefore command only
about half the quantity of labour, half the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>quantity of cloth, half the quantity of hardware,
half the quantity of hats and shoes, and
of all those commodities which are in their
natural and ordinary state. To all these
objects money will probably bear nearly the
same relation as before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where, then, is the truth of saying, that
money would not be here discharging a particular
function more than the other commodity?
Broad, glaring, and incontrovertible
facts show, that for short periods money <em>does</em>
perform the function of measuring the variations
in the general power of purchasing
possessed by the corn; but that the corn does
<em>not</em> measure the variations in the general
power of purchasing possessed by the money.
This is one of the instances of that extraordinary
inattention to facts which, most unfortunately
for the science of political economy,
the professors of it have lately indulged themselves
in.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author has said a great deal in good
set phrase about the false analogy involved
in the application of the term <em>measure</em> to the
value of commodities at different periods; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>gravely states the difference between measuring
length at different periods and measuring
value.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was not aware that people were ignorant
of this difference. As I said before, whenever
mention is made of the value of a commodity
at different periods, I have always
thought that a reference has been intended
either to its general power of purchasing, or
to something calculated to express the estimation
in which it was held at these different
periods, founded on the state of its supply
compared with the demand, or the elementary
costs of its production.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the term has been generally understood
in this way, people must have been
fully aware that value was essentially different
from length: they would know perfectly well
that a piece of cloth of a yard long would continue
to be a yard long when it was sent to
China; but that its value, that is, its general
power of purchasing in China, or the estimation
in which it was held there, would probably
be essentially altered. But allowing
this most marked distinction, and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>value of a commodity cannot be so well defined,
and its variations so accurately measured,
as the length of a commodity—where
is the false analogy of endeavouring to measure
these variations as well as we can? We
cannot certainly describe the wealth of a merchant,
nor measure the increase of his wealth
during the last four years, with the same exactness
as we can describe the height of a boy,
and measure the amount of his growth during
the same period. We can perform the latter
operation with the most perfect precision by
means of a foot-rule. The nature of wealth,
and the best instruments used to measure its
increase, are such, that the same precision is
unattainable; but there is no false analogy
involved in the process of measuring the
wealth of a merchant at one time with his
wealth four years before, by the number of
pounds sterling which he possesses now, as
compared with the number of pounds sterling
he possessed at the former period. What
false analogy is involved in applying money
to measure the value of the advances of a manufacturer,
as compared with the value of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>returns, in order to estimate his profits? and
what can the author mean by saying, that no
relation of value can exist between commodities
at different periods;<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a> and that it is a
case where money has no function to perform?</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding such assertions, we see
every day the most perfect conviction prevailing
among all agriculturists, merchants,
manufacturers, and shopkeepers, and among
all writers on political economy, except the
author, that to estimate the relation of commodities,
at different periods, in regard to
their general power of purchasing, and particularly
the power of purchasing labour,
the main instrument of production, is a most
important function, which it is peculiarly
desirable to have performed; and that, for
moderately short periods, money <em>does</em> perform
this function with very tolerable accuracy.
And for this specific reason; that, for moderately
short periods, a given quantity of
money will represent, more nearly than any
other commodity, the general power of purchasing,
and particularly the power of setting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>labour in motion, so vital to the capitalist.
It will approach, in short, more nearly than
any other commodity, to that invariability
which the author thinks so utterly useless in
a measure of value, and the very mention of
which seems to excite his indignation.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is, in fact, by means of this same steadiness
of value in the precious metals, which
they derive from their great durability, and
the consequent uniformity of their supply in
the market, that they are enabled to perform
their most important functions. Hops, or
corn, as before stated, will measure the relative
values of commodities at the same time
and place; but let the author or reader
attempt to estimate the profits of a capitalist
in hops or corn, by the excess of the
value of his advances above the value of his
returns so estimated, and he will soon be
bewildered. If a very plentiful year of corn
were to succeed to a comparatively scarce
one, the farmer, estimating both his outgoings
and incomings in the corn of each year,
might appear to gain above fifty per cent.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>while, in reality, he might have lost, and
might not be able, without trenching on his
capital, to employ as many men on his farm
as the year before. On the other hand, if a
comparatively scarce year were to succeed to
a plentiful one, his profits, estimated in corn,
might appear to be less than nothing, and
yet he might have been an unusual gainer,
in reference to his general power of purchasing
labour and other commodities, except
corn. If the hop-planter were to estimate
his advances and returns in hops, it is
obvious that the results would be of the same
kind, but aggravated in degree.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be allowed, then, that the commercial
world have acted most wisely in selecting,
for their practical measure of value, a
commodity which is not only peculiarly convenient
in its form, but is, in general, subject
only to slow changes of value; and possesses,
therefore, that steadiness in its power of
purchasing labour and commodities, without
which, all confidence in carrying on mercantile
enterprises, of any duration, would be at
an end.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>But though the precious metals are a very
useful and excellent measure of value for
those periods, within which almost all mercantile
transactions are begun and completed;
yet, as Adam Smith very justly observes,
they are not so for very long periods; not
because there is no function for them to perform,
but because, in the course of four
hundred years, they are found to lose that
uniformity of value, which, in general, they
retain so well during four years.</p>

<p class='c011'>I can by no means, therefore, agree with
the author, when he says, speaking of the
precious metals, that, “in regard to measuring
or comparing value, there is no operation
that can be intelligibly described, or
consistently imagined, but may be performed
by the media of which we are in possession.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
Surely, to measure the relative power of a
commodity over labour and the mass of other
commodities, at different and distant times,
is an operation which may be both consistently
imagined, and intelligibly described;
yet it is quite certain, that, in regard to distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>periods, the precious metals will not
perform this well. Would the author himself
venture to say, that the general power of
purchasing possessed by an ounce of silver
in the time of Edward the Third, was not
very much greater than the general power
of purchasing possessed by an ounce of
silver in the time of George the Fourth;
or, that the same quantity of agricultural
labour, at these two periods, would not much
more nearly have represented the same general
power of purchasing? The author
seems equally unfortunate when he launches
out in praise of the precious metals as a
measure of value, as when he says that they
do not perform this function better than
corn.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be observed that, in speaking of the
values of commodities, at different periods,
as meaning their different powers of purchasing
at those periods, the kind of value
referred to is, exclusively, value in exchange.
And, in reference to value in exchange, exclusively,
it appears to be of the utmost
importance to the language of political economy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to distinguish between the power of
purchasing generally, and the power of purchasing
any one commodity.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it must not be imagined that when
the estimation in which a commodity is held
at different periods is referred to, as determined
at the time by the state of the supply
compared with the demand, and ordinarily
by the natural and necessary conditions of its
supply, or by the elementary costs of its production,
which are equivalent expressions,
that value in exchange is lost sight of. Yet
the author is continually falling into this kind
of misapprehension, and into a total forgetfulness
of his first account of the meaning of
value, in his examination of Mr. Ricardo’s
views, as to the uses of a measure of value,
in which, he says, a singular confusion of
thought is to be discovered.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose, he observes, that we had such a
commodity as Mr. Ricardo requires for a
standard: suppose, for instance, all commodities
to be produced by labour alone, and
silver to be produced by an invariable quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of labour. In this case, silver would be,
according to Mr. Ricardo, a perfect measure
of value. But in what sense? What is the
function performed? Silver, even if invariable
in its producing labour, will tell us
nothing of the value of other commodities.
Their relations in value to silver, or their
prices, must be ascertained in the usual way;
and, when ascertained, we shall certainly
know the values of commodities in relation
to each other; but in all this, there is no
assistance derived from the producing labour
of silver being a constant quantity.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I have already described the function which
silver would have to perform in this case,
namely, either to measure the different powers
of purchasing possessed by commodities
at different periods, or to measure the different
degrees of estimation in which they
were held at these different periods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, in the first place, with regard to the
general power of purchasing, can it be denied
for a moment, that, granting all the premises,
as the author does hypothetically, silver, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>produced, would be, beyond comparison, a
better measure of the power of purchasing
generally, than silver as it has been actually
produced? It would be secured from that
greatest source of variation in the general
power of purchasing occasioned by the variation
in its own producing labour; and an
ounce of such silver would command much
more nearly the same quantity of labour and
commodities, for four or five hundred years
together, than an ounce of silver derived
from mines of greatly varying fertility.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly, with regard to the estimation in
which a commodity is held, it is not easy to
conceive a more complete measure. If all
commodities were produced by labour alone,
and exchanged with each other according to
the producing labour; and if silver were
produced by an invariable quantity of labour,
the quantity of silver given for a commodity
in the market at different periods, would
express almost accurately the relative estimation
in which it was held at these periods;
because it would express at once the relative
sacrifice which people were willing to make,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>in order to obtain such a commodity at these
different periods; the relative conditions of
the supply, or elementary costs of production,
of such commodity at these periods;
and the proportion of the produce to the
producer, or the relative state of the demand,
as compared with the supply of such commodity
at these different periods. And if the
value of a commodity means, as the author
has told us in the first sentence of his book,
the esteem in which it is held, Mr. Ricardo’s
measure would certainly do all which he proposed
it should do; and this specifically on
account of its invariability in relation to the
estimation in which it was held.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would not merely indicate, as the author
states, in which of two commodities varying
in relation to each other, at different periods,
the variation had taken place;<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> but it would
express the precise amount of the variation;
that is, if it appeared by documents that the
price of a yard of cloth of a certain quality
four hundred years ago was twenty shillings,
and its price at present was only ten shillings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>it would follow, that the estimation in which
it was held, or its value, had fallen one-half;
because, as all commodities are, by the supposition,
produced by labour alone, the sacrifice
with which it could be obtained, the
necessary conditions of its supply, or the
elementary costs of its production, had diminished
one-half.</p>

<p class='c011'>The variations of a commodity, in relation
to this kind of standard, would further show,
with great exactness, the variations in its
power of commanding all those commodities
which had not altered in the conditions of
their supply, or the elementary costs of
production. If a commodity rose or fell in
this standard price, at different periods, it
would necessarily rise or fall exactly in the
same proportion in its power of commanding,
in exchange, all those commodities which
had not altered in the conditions of their
supply, or their elementary costs of production.</p>

<p class='c011'>But still, it will be readily acknowledged,
that, even granting all that the author has
granted hypothetically to Mr. Ricardo, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>not true that such silver would be an <em>accurate</em>
measure of the general power of purchasing.
Although the circumstance of its invariability,
in regard to its producing labour, would give
it a prodigious superiority over all other
commodities even in this respect, yet, as the
producing labour of many commodities may
vary in the progress of society, it is quite
impossible that the same quantity of any one
object can, through successive periods, represent
the same general power of purchasing.
This is universally allowed; and
as it would be clearly desirable to have <em>one</em>
rather than <em>two</em> definitions of value, the
question is, whether, both on this account,
and on account of the universal language and
practice of society, for short periods, it
would not be decidedly better to confine the
term value of a commodity, when used generally,
to the estimation in which it is held,
determined by the state of the supply compared
with the demand, and ordinarily by
the elementary costs of production, rather
than to its general power of purchasing.
There is very nearly an accurate measure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the former; it is universally acknowledged
that there cannot be an accurate measure of
the latter; and further, it is most important
to remark that, in adopting the former, our
language would much more nearly coincide
with the ordinary language of society in referring
to variations of value, than if we
adopted the latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a matter of fact, when a rise in the
value of hops or of corn is spoken of, who
ever thinks about the changes which may
have taken place in the values of iron, flax,
or cabbages? For short periods, we consider
money as nearly a correct measure of the
values of commodities, as well as of their
prices; and if hops and corn have risen in
this measure, we do not hesitate to say that
their values have risen, without the least
reference to cloths, calicoes, or cambrics.
This is a clear proof that, in general, when
we speak of the variations in the values of
commodities, we do not measure them by
the variations in their general power of purchasing,
but by some sort of standard which
we think better represents the varying estimation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>in which they are held, determined at
all times by the state of the supply compared
with the demand, and, on an average, by the
elementary costs of production.</p>

<p class='c011'>The only variations in the general power
of a commodity to purchase, which are susceptible
of a distinct and definite measure,
are those which arise from causes which
affect the commodity itself, and not from the
causes which affect the innumerable articles
against which it is capable of being exchanged.
In speaking, therefore, of the variations
in the value of particular commodities,
it is not only more accordant with the accustomed
meaning attached to the expression,
but absolutely necessary with a view to precision,
to consider them as exclusively proportioned
to, and measured by, the amount
of the causes of value operating upon themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Ricardo, therefore, quite consistently
with his own hypothesis, considers a commodity,
the producing labour of which has
doubled, as having increased to double its
former value. It has increased in relation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>a standard which, according to him, is the
sole cause of value; it will command just
double the quantity of all those commodities
which have not altered in their producing
value; and if it will not command just double
the quantity of other commodities, it is not
because it will not command just double the
<em>value</em> which it did before, but because, on
account of the changes in the producing
labour of the other commodities, double the
quantity of them has become more or less than
double the value.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the same principle, Adam Smith considers
the value of cattle as rising in the progress
of cultivation and improvement, although
the value of land, the value of wood,
the value of poultry, &amp;c., might rise still
higher, and, consequently, a given quantity
of cattle might, with regard to some commodities
or sets of commodities, have its power
of purchasing diminished. But in saying that
the value of cattle rises in the progress of
cultivation, he means to say, that it rises in
relation to a standard, namely, the labour a
commodity will command, which represents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>at different periods the state of the supply of
cattle compared with the demand, and, on an
average, the elementary costs of their production;
and, consequently, much better
represents the estimation in which they are
held than any commodity or set of commodities.
“Labour,” he observes, “it must
always be remembered, and not any particular
commodity, or set of commodities, is
the real measure of the value both of silver
and of all other commodities.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Even the author himself has a chapter on
the causes of value; and here he finds it
absolutely necessary to estimate the causes
affecting one commodity as distinct from the
causes affecting another; although, according
to his previous doctrine, the value of
one commodity might be just as powerfully
affected by causes operating upon another
commodity as by causes operating upon itself:
If <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> be compared, the value of <em>a</em> will
be equally doubled, whether the elementary
cost of <em>a</em> be doubled or the elementary cost
of <em>b</em> be diminished one half; and so no doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>it would, if the relation of <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> were alone
considered. But what does this prove? not
that the value of <em>a</em> is not very differently
affected in the two cases, according to the
most ordinary, the most useful, and the most
correct acceptation of the term value; but
that to confine the term value, as the author
does, to the mere relation of any one commodity
to any other, is to render it pre-eminently
futile and useless.</p>

<p class='c011'>In first separating value in exchange from
value in use, it may be allowable to distinguish
it by the title of the power of purchasing
other goods, as Adam Smith has
done, though never to interpret this power
as the power of purchasing any one sort of
goods, as the author has done. But the moment
we come to inquire into the variations
of the values of commodities at different
periods, we must, with any view to precision
and utility, draw a marked line of distinction
between a variation in the power of purchasing
derived from causes affecting the
particular purchasing commodities, and the
variations in the power of purchasing which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>may arise from causes operating upon the
purchased commodities. We must confine
our attention exclusively to the former; and
for this purpose refer to some standard which
will best enable us to estimate the variations
in the elementary costs of production, and in
the state of the demand and supply of these
commodities, as the best criterion of their
varying value, or the varying estimation in
which they are held at different periods.</p>

<p class='c011'>On these grounds, Mr. Ricardo, consistently
with his peculiar theory, measures the
varying values of commodities at different
periods by their producing labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Adam Smith, consistently with his
more just and applicable theory, measures
the values of commodities at different periods
by the labour which they will command.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the author’s chapters is one (the
seventh) entitled “On the Measure of Value
proposed by Mr. Malthus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to prepare himself for the refutations
intended, he sums up his principal doctrines
respecting value; and as they are here
brought into a small compass, I cannot resist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the temptation of quoting them in his own
words.</p>

<p class='c011'>He says, “It has been shown that the
value of labour, like that of any other exchangeable
article, is denoted by the quantity
of some other commodity for which a definite
portion of it will exchange, and must rise
or fall as that quantity becomes greater or
smaller, these phrases being only different
expressions of the same event. Hence,
unless labour always exchanges for the same
quantity of other things, its value cannot be
invariable, and, consequently, the very supposition
of its being, at one and the same time,
invariable, and capable of measuring the variations
of other commodities, involves a contradiction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has also been shown, that to term anything
immutable in value, amidst the fluctuations
of other things, implies that its value
at one time may be compared with its value
at another time, without reference to any
other commodity, which is absurd, value
denoting a relation between two things at the
same time; and it has likewise been shown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>that in no sense could an object of invariable
value be of any peculiar service in the capacity
of a measure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These considerations,” he says, “are quite
sufficient to overturn the claims of the proposed
measure, as maintained by its advocate.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I am most ready to acknowledge that they
are amply sufficient for the purpose, if they
are true. But is it possible that doctrines
can be true, which, having no other foundation
than a most arbitrary and unwarranted
interpretation of a definition of Adam Smith,
lead directly to the subjoined conclusions?</p>

<p class='c011'>First; That the value of labour rises or falls
as a given portion of it will exchange for a
greater or less quantity of silk or any other
commodity, however unconnected with the
labourer’s wants; so that if silks were to fall
to one-half their price, the value of labour
would be doubled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly; That the value of corn in one
year cannot be compared with the value
of corn in another, because value denotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>only a relation between two things at the same
time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And thirdly, That the comparative steadiness
in the value of the precious metals, for
short periods, is of no service to them in the
capacity of a measure of value.</p>

<p class='c011'>The decision of the question, as to the
truth of doctrines necessarily leading to such
conclusions, may be safely left to the reader.
But to return to the main subject of the
chapter, namely, the measure of value proposed
by me.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a publication entitled “<cite>The Measure of
Value stated and illustrated</cite>,” I had given
reasons, which appeared to me convincing, for
adopting labour, in the sense in which it is
generally understood and applied by Adam
Smith, as the measure of value; and further
to illustrate the subject, and bring into one
view the results of different suppositions respecting
the varying fertility of the soil and
the varying quantity of corn paid to the labourer,
I added a table in which different
suppositions of this kind are made.</p>

<p class='c011'>In reference to this table the author observes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that “In the same way any article
might be proved to be of invariable value,
for instance, ten yards of cloth. For whether
we gave 5<em>l.</em> or 10<em>l.</em> for the ten yards, the sum
given would always be equal in value to the
cloth for which it was paid, or, in other words,
of invariable value in relation to cloth. But
that which is given for a thing of invariable
value must itself be invariable, whence the
ten yards of cloth must be of invariable
value.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This comparison shows either a most singular
want of discrimination, or a purposed
disregard of the premises on which the table
is founded. These premises are, that the
natural and necessary conditions of the supply
of the great mass of commodities, or, in other
words, their elementary costs of production,
are, the accumulated and immediate labour
necessary to produce them, with the addition
of the ordinary profits upon the whole
advances for the time they have been
advanced; and that the ordinary values
of commodities at different periods, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>to the most customary application of the
term, are determined by the elementary costs
of production at those periods, that is,
by the labour and profits worked up in
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>If these premises be just, the table correctly
illustrates all that it was intended to illustrate.
If the premises be false, the whole
falls to the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, I would ask the author, what sort of
resemblance there is between ten yards of
cloth and ten days’ labour? Is cloth the
universal and the main instrument of production?
Is the advance of an adequate
quantity of cloth the natural and necessary
condition of the supply of all commodities?
Has any one ever thought of calling cloth and
profits the elementary costs of production?
or has it ever been proposed to estimate the
values of commodities at different periods by
the different quantities of cloth and profits
worked up in them?</p>

<p class='c011'>If these questions cannot be answered in
the affirmative, it is obvious that what may be
true and important with regard to labour, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>be perfectly false or futile in regard to any
<em>product</em> of labour.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> The whole depends upon
the mode of estimating the values of commodities.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would, no doubt, be an absurd tautological
truism merely to state, that the varying
wages of a given quantity of labour will
always command the same quantity of labour;
but if it were previously shown that the quantity
of labour which a commodity commands
represents exactly the quantity of labour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>worked up in it, with the profits upon the
advances, and does therefore really represent
and measure those natural and necessary
conditions of the supply, those elementary
costs of production which determine value;
then the truism that the varying wages of a
given quantity of labour always command the
same quantity of labour, must necessarily
involve the important truth, that the elementary
costs of producing the varying wages of
a given quantity of labour must always be the
same.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is obvious to any person inspecting the
table, that the uniform numbers in the seventh
column, illustrating the invariable value of the
wages of a given number of men, might, with
perfect certainty, have been stated without
the intermediate steps; but if they had been
so stated, no conclusion respecting the constancy
of the value of such wages could have
been drawn. The intermediate steps, which
show that the value of the wages of ten men
is there estimated by the causes which had
been previously shown to determine the
values of all commodities, can alone warrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the conclusion that the uniform numbers in
the seventh column imply uniformity of value
in the wages.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Ricardo had stated repeatedly, that
the value of the wages of labour must necessarily
rise in the progress of society. He
builds, indeed, the whole foundation of his
theory of profits on the rise and fall of the
value of labour. The table shows that, if we
estimate the value of wages by the labour
worked up in them, that is, by one element
of value, Mr. Ricardo is right, and the value
of wages will really rise as poorer land is
taken into cultivation; but that, if we estimate
the value of wages by the labour and
<em>profits</em> worked up in them, that is, by the two
elementary ingredients of value, the value of
wages will remain the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author says that, from the remarks he
has made, the reader will perceive that Mr.
Malthus’s “Table illustrating the invariable
value of labour,” absolutely proves nothing;<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
and he concludes his chapter with observing,
that his “cursory review evinces that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>formidable array of figures in the table yields
not a single new or important truth.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I was not aware that it was ever expected
from a tabular arrangement, that it should afford
logical proofs of new propositions; but, if
the author means that, taking the whole publication
together, it contains nothing new or
important, though I may be bound to believe
it in relation to his own reading and his own
views, I cannot help doubting it a little in
regard to the reading and views of many
others; and I am quite certain that, with
regard to myself, the view I there took of the
subject of value, and of the reasons for
adopting labour as its measure, was, in many
of its parts, quite new to me a year before
the publication.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place; I had nowhere seen it
stated, that the ordinary quantity of labour
which a commodity will command must represent
and measure the quantity of labour
worked up in it, with the addition of profits.
But, as soon as my attention was strongly
drawn to this truth, the labour which a commodity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>would ordinarily command appeared
to me in a new light. I had before considered
labour as the most general and the
most important of all the objects given in
exchange, and, therefore, by far the best
measure of the general power of purchasing
of any one object; but after I became aware
that, by representing the labour worked up in
a commodity, with the profits, it represented
the natural and necessary conditions of its
supply, or the elementary costs of its production,
its importance, as a measure, appeared
to me very greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly; I had nowhere seen it stated
that, however the fertility of the soil might
vary, the elementary costs of producing the
wages of a given quantity of labour must
always necessarily be the same. Colonel
Torrens, in adverting to a measure of value,
says, “In the first place, exchangeable value
is determined by the cost of production; and
there is no commodity, the cost of producing
which is not liable to perpetual fluctuation.
In the second place, even if a commodity
could be found which always required the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>same expenditure for its production, it would
not, therefore, be of invariable exchangeable
value, so as to serve as a standard for
measuring the value of other things. Exchangeable
value is determined, not by the
absolute, but by the relative, cost of production.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>I had been convinced, however, that, with
a view to superior accuracy and utility, and
a more complete conformity to the language
and practice of society, in estimating the
varying values of commodities for short
periods, it was necessary to separate the
variations in the power of a commodity to
purchase, into two parts; the first, derived
from causes operating upon the commodity
itself; the second, from causes operating
upon other commodities; and, in speaking
of the variations in the exchangeable value
of a commodity, to refer only to the former.
In this case it is obvious that, according to
Colonel Torrens, we should possess a measure
of value if we could find an object the
cost of producing which was always the same.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Now it is shown, in the “<cite>Measure of value
stated and illustrated</cite>,” that the conditions of
the supply of labour, or the elementary costs
of producing the corn wages of a given
number of men, estimated just in the same
way as we should estimate the elementary
costs of producing cloth, linens, hardware,
or any other commodity, must of necessity
always remain the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>I own that these two necessary qualities of
the labour, which commodities will <em>ordinarily</em>
command, were practically new to me; and,
when forced on my attention, and accompanied
by the conviction above described, as
to the most correct and useful definition of
value, made me view labour as a measure of
value, so far approaching towards accuracy,
considering the nature of the subject, that it
might fairly be called a standard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The publication was also marked by another
peculiarity, which I cannot but consider as of
some importance: namely, the constant use
of the term <em>labour and profits</em>, instead of the
customary one, <em>labour and capital</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be allowed that the expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span><em>labour and capital</em> is essentially tautological.
In every definition of capital I have met with,
the means of commanding labour are included;
and there can be no doubt that machinery
and raw materials require labour
for their production of the same general
description, and usually in as large a proportion,
as the labour advanced by the last
capitalist. Speaking loosely, we may indeed
use the expression <em>labour and capital</em>, meaning
by capital, when so used, all that part of the
general description of capital which does not
consist of the means of commanding the
immediate labour required. But when we
are engaged in an inquiry into the elements
of value, nothing can be more unphilosophical
than to talk of labour and capital. Excluding
rent and taxes, the only elements concerned
in regulating the value of commodities are
labour and profits, including, of course, in
such labour, the labour worked up in the
raw materials, and that portion of the machinery
worn out in the production; and
including in the profits, the profits of the producers
of the raw materials and machinery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>To say that the values of commodities are
regulated or determined by the <em>quantity</em> of
<em>capital and labour</em> necessary to produce them
is essentially false. To say that the values
of commodities are regulated by the quantities
of labour <em>and profits</em> necessary to
produce them is, I believe, essentially true.
And if so, it was a point of some importance
to substitute the expression <em>labour and profits</em>
for the customary one of <em>labour and
capital</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have been detained longer than I intended
by the Critical Dissertation on the
Nature, Measures, and Causes of Value.
There is still matter of animadversion remaining;
but were I to go on I should tire
my readers, if I have not done it already.</p>

<p class='c011'>The author, when not under the influence
of his peculiar definitions, makes some very
just observations; and the work is exceedingly
well written; which makes it a matter
of greater surprise that its main proposition
should be so strikingly adverse to the principle
of utility, and so peculiarly calculated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to retard the progress of that science which
it must have been intended to promote.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not think it necessary to the object I
have in view, to proceed further with these
remarks on the definition and use of terms
among political economists. What I have
already said, if just, will be sufficient to show
that much uncertainty has arisen from our<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
negligence on this important point, and much
improvement might be expected from greater
attention to it. I shall now, therefore,
proceed to define some of the principal terms
in political economy, as nearly as I can,
according to the rules laid down. But before
I begin, I think it may be useful to give a
summary of the reasons for adopting the
subjoined definition of the measure of value.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX.</span><br /> <span class='large'>SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR ADOPTING THE SUBJOINED DEFINITION OF THE MEASURE OF VALUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As a preliminary, it may be proper to state,
that it seems absolutely essential to the
language of political economy, that the expression
<em>value of a commodity</em>, like the
expression <em>price of a commodity</em>, should have
some fixed and determined sense attached
to it. Every person who has either written
or talked on the subject of political economy,
has been constantly in the habit of using the
term without specifically expressing the object
of comparison intended: and if it were true,
that we might with equal propriety suppose
any one of a thousand different objects
referred to, it might easily be shown, that
all past writers who had used the term value
had talked the greatest nonsense; and all
future writers must abound in the most tedious
circumlocutions and the most futile propositions.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>But the author of the Critical Dissertation
on Value has certainly done injustice to the
writers who have gone before him, in supposing
that when they have used the term
value of a commodity, no reference was
implied, if it was not expressed. As I stated
before, they must be considered as referring,
in some form or other, either to its general
power of purchasing, or, to the estimation in
which it was held, determined by the state of
its supply compared with the demand, and,
on an average, by the elementary costs of
production; and as it would be perfectly ridiculous
to suppose, that when the values of
commodities, at different periods, are spoken
of generally, by respectable writers, they
could mean to refer to individual commodities
not intended to represent, more or less
accurately, the above objects of reference;
it is obvious, that the ultimate reference
implied must be confined to one of these, or
their equivalents.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have already given my reasons for thinking
it more correct and useful to refer to the
estimation in which a commodity is held,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>determined as above described, rather than
to its general power of purchasing; but, as
others may be of a different opinion, it may
be useful to include among the reasons for
adopting labour as a measure of value, its
qualities as a measure of the general power
of purchasing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Supposing, then, that the exchangeable
value of a commodity were defined to be its
general power of purchasing, this must refer
to the power of purchasing the mass of
commodities; but this mass is quite unmanageable,
and the power of purchasing it
can never be ascertained. With a view,
therefore, to its practical application, it would
unquestionably be our endeavour to fix upon
some object, or set of objects, which would
best represent an average of the general mass.
Now, of any one object, it cannot for a moment
be denied that labour best represents an
average of the general mass of productions.
There is no commodity considered by society
as wealth, for which labour is not, in the first
instance, exchanged; there are very few for
which it is not exchanged in great quantities:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and this can be said of no other object,
except labour, and the circulating medium
which represents it. It is, at once, the first,
the universal, and the most important object
given in exchange for all commodities; and
if to this we add, that while there is one large
class of commodities, such as raw products,
which in the progress of society tends to rise
as compared with labour, there is another
large class of commodities, such as manufactured
articles, which at the same time tends
to fall; it may not be far from the truth
to say, that the portion of the average mass
of commodities which a given quantity of
labour will command in the same country,
during the course of some centuries, may not
very essentially vary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Allowing, however, that it would vary, and
that labour is an imperfect measure of the
general power of purchasing; yet, if some
sort of standard more applicable than the
mass of commodities be required, and labour
appears to be beyond comparison the best
representative of this mass, there will be
a very powerful reason for adopting labour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>as the practical measure of value, even
among those who may persevere in thinking
that the best definition of value in exchange
is the general power of purchasing.</p>

<p class='c011'>To those, however, who hold the opinion
that the variations in the exchangeable value
of a commodity and the variations in its
power of purchasing are not identical, and
that a commodity increases in exchangeable
value only when it will command a <em>greater
value in exchange</em>, while its power of purchasing
may increase merely because it will
command a <em>greater quantity</em> of commodities
which have confessedly fallen in value, the
reasons for adopting labour as the measure of
value will be found to increase tenfold in force.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are various ways of describing value
in the sense here understood; and the slightest
examination of them will show that the
labour which a commodity will command can
alone be the measure of such value.</p>

<p class='c011'>First; The author of the Critical Dissertation
on Value has commenced his work by a
description of it, in which I entirely agree
with him. He says, as I have before stated,
that “value, in its ultimate sense, appears to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>mean the esteem in which any object is held.
But it is obvious that the degree of this
esteem cannot be measured by comparing
it with another commodity about which we
know as little as of the first. The comparison
with money would leave us as much
in the dark as ever, if we did not previously
know the estimation in which money was
held.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Even the mere <em>relative</em> values of two
commodities cannot be inferred by putting
them side by side, and looking at them for
any length of time. Before we can attain
even this partial conclusion, we must refer
each of them to the desires of man, and the
means of production; that is, we must make
a previous comparison, in order to ascertain
the value of each before we can venture to
say what relation one bears to the other. It
is this primary comparison which, independently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of any secondary comparison, determines
the estimation in which the commodity
is held. And as this primary comparison can
only be represented by the exchange with labour,
it is certain that, if we define the value
of a commodity to be the estimation in which
it is held, the quantity of labour which it will
command can alone measure this estimation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Secondly: Locke, most justly looking to the
foundation of all value, considers the value
of commodities as determined by the proportion
of their quantity to their vent, or of
the supply to the demand; but the varying
vent or demand for one commodity cannot
possibly be represented by the varying quantity
of another commodity for which it is exchanged,
unless the second commodity remain
steady in regard to labour. If at one time I
give two pounds of hops for a yard of cloth,
and at another time only one, it does not
at all follow that the demand for cloth has
diminished; on the contrary, it may be increased,
and in giving the value of one pound
of hops, I may have enabled the cloth manufacturer
to set more men to work, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>obtain higher profits than when I gave the
value of two pounds. But the demand for
a commodity, though not proportioned to the
<em>quantity</em> of any other commodity which the
purchaser is willing and able to give for it,
is really proportioned to <em>the quantity of labour</em>
which he will give for it; and for this
reason: the quantity of labour which a commodity
will <em>ordinarily</em> command, represents
exactly the effectual demand for it; because
it represents exactly that of labour
and profits united necessary to effect its supply;<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
while the <em>actual</em> quantity of labour
which a commodity will command when it
differs from the <em>ordinary</em> quantity, represents
the excess or defect of demand arising from
temporary causes. If then looking to the
foundation of all value, namely; the limitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of the supply as compared with the wants of
mankind, we consider the value of commodities
at any time or place as proportioned to
the state of their supply compared with the
demand at that time and place, it is evident
that the quantity of labour of the same time
and place which any commodity, or parcels
of commodities, will command, can alone
represent and measure the state of the supply
of them as compared with the demand,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a> and
their values as founded on this relation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thirdly: It has often been stated that the
value of a commodity is determined by the
sacrifice which people are willing to make in
order to obtain it; and this seems to be perfectly
true. But the question recurs, how are
we to measure this sacrifice? It is obvious
that we cannot measure it by the <em>quantity</em> of
another commodity which we are willing to
give in exchange for it. When I give more
calicoes, or more potatoes, than I did before,
for a certain quantity of hardware, it does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>at all follow that I make a greater sacrifice in
order to obtain what I want. On the contrary,
if calicoes and potatoes had both fallen
in price, the one from improved machinery
and the other from the abundance of the
season, my sacrifice might even have been
less rather than greater. Even the quantity
of money which is given for a commodity is
no measure of the sacrifice made to obtain it.
Though it is an excellent measure of the
variations in the sacrifice made, at the same
time and place; yet without further information,
it will tell us nothing either about the
amount, or the variations at different places
and times. The giving of an ounce of silver
was a very different sacrifice in the time of
Edward I. from what it is at present. It is
obvious, therefore, that the sacrifice which
we are willing to make, in order to obtain a
particular commodity, is not proportioned to
the <em>quantity</em> of any other commodity for which
it will exchange, but to the difficulty with
which such quantity, whether more or less, is
attained. Now labour can measure this difficulty,
but nothing else can. If, then, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>value of a commodity be determined by the
sacrifice which people are willing to make in
order to obtain it, it is the labour given for a
commodity, and labour alone, which can measure
this sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fourthly: In the <cite>Measure of Value Stated
and Illustrated</cite>, I considered the value of commodities
as, on an average, determined by
the natural and necessary conditions of their
supply. These conditions I stated to be the
accumulated and immediate labour worked
up in commodities with the ordinary profits
upon the whole advances for the time that
they were advanced. And it appeared, both
in the early part of the discussion, and in the
Table, that the quantity of labour which a
commodity would ordinarily command must
represent and measure the quantity of labour
worked up in it with the addition of profits.
It was certainly a very remarkable fact, that
when Mr. Ricardo chose the labour worked
up in commodities “as, under many circumstances,
an invariable standard,” and rejected
the labour which they would ordinarily purchase
as subject to as many fluctuations as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the commodities compared with it,<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a> he should
not have seen that the labour which a commodity
will ordinarily command, necessarily
involves his own proposition, with that addition
to it merely which can alone make it
correct; and that it is precisely because the
labour which a commodity will ordinarily
command measures the labour actually worked
up in it with the addition of profits, that it is
justifiable to consider it as a measure of
value. If then the ordinary value of a commodity
be considered as determined by the
natural and necessary conditions of its supply,
it is certain that the labour which it will
ordinarily command is alone the measure of
these conditions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fifthly: The values of commodities are
often said to be determined by the costs of
production. When the costs of production
do not refer to money, but to those simple
elements of production, without an adequate
quantity of which, whatever may be their
price in money, the commodity cannot be
produced, they are precisely the same as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>natural and necessary conditions of the supply.
The elementary costs of production, excluding
rents and taxes, are the labour and profits
required to produce a commodity. Of these
it has been already shown, that the labour
which the commodity will ordinarily command
is alone the measure; and allowing
that we could obtain with tolerable exactness
the average price of common agricultural
labour at different times and in different
countries, and that when the prices of all
other sorts of labour were once established,
they would (as assumed by Adam Smith
and Mr. Ricardo) continue to bear nearly
the same relation to each other in the
further progress of cultivation and improvement,
it is certain that the quantity of common
agricultural labour which a commodity
would ordinarily command at any place and
time would measure, with a near approach to
accuracy, the elementary costs of production
at that place and time; so that commodities,
which at two different periods in the same
country would ordinarily command the same
quantity of agricultural labour, might fairly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>be said to be equal to each other in their
elementary costs of production, and, of course,
in their values, if their values be determined
by their elementary costs of production.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sixthly: It may be said that the value of
a commodity must be proportioned to its
supply compared with the number of its producers.
This appears, indeed, to be strikingly
the case in the early periods of society when
many commodities are obtained, almost exclusively,
by labour. If fruits are to be
procured, or game killed or caught, by labour
alone, or assisted only by capital of very
little value, the quantity obtained, on an
average, by a day’s labour must represent,
with a great approach to accuracy, the degree
of scarcity in which commodities exist compared
with the producers of them working for
a certain time. But the degree in which the
supply of a commodity is limited, as compared
with the numbers, powers, and wants of those
who wish to obtain it, is the foundation of all
value. Here the producers are both the effectual
demanders and the consumers; and the
produce obtained on an average by a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>producer must represent the supply compared
with the numbers, powers, and wants of the
demanders. If a large quantity of produce
be obtained by a producer, the commodity
will be in abundance, and will be considered
as of comparatively little value; if a small
quantity be obtained by a producer, the commodity
will be scarce, and will be considered
as of comparatively great value. If it be the
custom of the country for the producers to
work only four hours a-day instead of ten or
twelve, the commodities produced will bear a
comparatively small proportion to the numbers
of the producers and effectual demanders,
and will consequently be of much higher
value, than in those countries where it is the
custom to work for the greater number of
hours; and, on the other hand, if the producers,
besides working ten or twelve hours
a-day, are aided by ingenious instruments and
great skill in the use of them, the commodities
produced will be in unusual plenty compared
with the producers, and will be considered
as proportionally of low value. In all
these cases the value of the commodity is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>evidently determined by the relation between
its quantity and the number of its producers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now though, in the more advanced stages
of society, the producer is not always at the
same time the demander and consumer; yet
the effectual demand for commodities must,
on an average, be proportioned to the productive
services set in motion to obtain them;<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
and when the different kinds of producers are
reduced to a common denominator, such as
common agricultural day-labour, and profits
are deducted as the remuneration of the
capitalist, and rent as the remuneration of
the landowner, the proportion which the remaining
produce bears to the number of such
producers must represent, exactly in the same
manner as in the early periods of society, the
degree of scarcity in which the commodity
exists compared with the producers; and
therefore the value of the commodity is measured
by the quantity of it which will command
a day’s common labour. In fact, if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>be once allowed that when labour is exclusively
concerned, the number of days’ labour
necessary to produce a commodity at any
place and time represents the natural value of
the commodity at that place and time<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a>, then,
as it is quite certain that the value in exchange
of any other commodity compared with the
first, will be accurately in proportion to the
respective quantities of the same kind of
labour which they will command, it follows
necessarily, that the value of the second commodity
must always be in proportion to the
quantity of labour it will command, however
its value may have been affected by profits,
rents, taxes, monopolies, or the accidental
state of its supply compared with the demand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seventhly: It has been stated that the
values of commodities must be proportioned
to the causes of value operating upon them.
The author of the Critical Dissertation has a
chapter on the causes of value, and, at the
conclusion of it, adverting to the variety of
considerations operating upon the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>mind, which he thinks have been overlooked
by political economists, he observes, “these
considerations are the causes of value; and
the attempt to proportion the quantities in
which commodities are exchanged for each
other to the degree in which one of these
considerations exists, must be vain and ineffectual.
All, in reality, that can be accomplished
on this subject, is to ascertain the
various causes of value; and, when this is
done, we may always infer, from an increase
or diminution of any of them, an increase or
diminution of the effect.”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>These remarks, it must be allowed, are
justly applicable to those who propose to
measure the values of commodities by the
quantity of labour actually bestowed upon
them; but in no degree to those who propose
to measure them by the quantity of labour
which they will command. We have already
shown that the labour which commodities
will command measures that paramount
cause of value which includes every other;
namely, the state of the supply as compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>with the demand. Whatever may be the
number and variety of considerations operating
on the mind in the interchange of
commodities, whether merely the common
elementary costs of production, or whether
these costs have been variously modified by
taxes, by portions of rent, by monopolies
strict or partial, and by temporary scarcity
or abundance, the result of the whole must
appear in the state of the supply compared
with the demand; and in the case of an
individual article, the supply of which may
be considered as given, the demand, must be
proportioned to the sacrifice which the purchasers
are able and, under all the circumstances,
willing to make in order to attain it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it has already been shown that it is
the command of labour which the purchasers
are able and willing to transfer to the sellers,
and not any particular commodity, except in
proportion as it will command labour, that
can alone represent the sacrifice of the purchasers.
The labour, therefore, which a
commodity will command, or which the purchasers
are willing to give for it, measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the result of all the causes of value acting
upon it,—of all the various considerations
operating upon the mind in the interchange
of commodities.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether then we consider the value of a
commodity at any place and time as expressed
by the estimation in which it is held; whether
we consider it as founded entirely on the
state of the supply as compared with the
demand; whether we consider it as determined
by the sacrifice which people are
willing to make in order to obtain it; or by
the natural and necessary conditions of its
supply; or by the elementary costs of its
production; or by the number of its producers;
or by the result of all the causes of
value operating upon it, it is plain that the
labour which it will ordinarily command in
any place will measure its natural and ordinary
value; and the labour which it will actually
command will measure its market value.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must always be recollected, however,
that in any sense in which we can use the
term <em>value of a commodity</em>, there must be a
reference, either expressed or implied, to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>place and time, in the same manner as when
we use the term <em>price of a commodity</em>. We
all well know that the price of the same kind
of commodity of the same quality, weight,
and dimensions, is very different in different
places and at different times; and this must
be equally true in regard to the value of a
commodity. It follows that, from the very
nature of the thing, the value of a commodity
cannot be expressed or measured independently
of place and time. It is this quality
which so essentially distinguishes the value of
a commodity from its length or weight; but
it does not necessarily destroy its capability
of being measured.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is true, however, that a very general
opinion has prevailed among political economists,
even since the publication of Adam
Smith’s work, that from the very nature of
value, so essentially different from length or
weight, it cannot admit of a regular and
definite measure.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> This opinion seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>me to have arisen principally from two
causes.</p>

<p class='c011'>First—a proper distinction has seldom
been made between the definitions of wealth
and value. Though the meanings of these
two terms have by no means always been
considered as the same, yet the characteristics
of one of them have been continually allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>to mix themselves with the characteristics of
the other. This appears even in Adam Smith
himself. When he says, that a man is rich
or poor according to the quantity of the
necessaries, conveniencies, and luxuries of life
which he can command, he gives a most
correct definition of wealth; but when he
afterwards says, that he is rich or poor
according to the quantity of labour which he
can command, he evidently confounds wealth
with value. The former is a definition of
wealth; and of this, or of the general power
of purchasing, which too much resembles it,
there is no measure. The latter is his own
definition or expression of real value; and of
this the very terms which he uses show that
there is a measure. The measure is distinctly
expressed in the terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second principal cause which has prevented
labour from being received, according
to the language of Adam Smith, as “alone
the ultimate and real standard by which the
value of all commodities can at all times and
places be estimated and compared,”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>that in different periods, and in different
countries, it is not really true, as stated by
him, that the labourer in working “lays
down the same portion of his ease, his
liberty, and his happiness.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> There is the
best reason to believe that the labourer in
India, and in many other countries, neither
exerts himself so much while he is working,
nor works for so many hours a day as an
English labourer. A day’s labour, therefore,
is not invariable either in regard to intensity
or time. But still it appears to me that, for
the reasons before stated, that is, because the
labour of each place and time measures at
that place and time the estimation in which a
commodity is held, the state of its supply
compared with the demand, the elementary
costs of its production, the natural and necessary
conditions of the supply, the proportion
of the produce to the producers, &amp;c.
it must be considered as measuring, with a
fair approach towards accuracy, the values of
commodities at these places and times, so as
to answer the question,—what was the value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>of broad-cloth of a certain description in the
time of Edward III. in England? or, what
is the value of money at present in China?
The nature of the measure, and the reason
why the varying intensity of the labour and
the different number of hours employed in
the day, do not disqualify it from performing
its functions, may perhaps be illustrated by
the following comparison:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us suppose that the heights of men in
different countries were extremely different,
varying from six feet to six inches, and that
the trees, shrubs, houses, utensils, and every
other product or article were all in proportion,
and that the foot-rule in each country bore
the same relation to the race of human beings
which inhabited it as the English foot-rule
does to Englishmen: then, though it is
obvious that the length of ten feet in one
nation might extend over a much larger
portion of space than ten feet in another
nation; yet the foot of each nation would
measure with accuracy the relative estimation
in which men and things were held in regard
to height, length, breadth, &amp;c. It would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>determine whether a man was tall or short
in the estimation of his fellow-citizens;
whether his shoulders were broad or narrow;
whether his circumference was great or
small; and not only whether Mr. Pike’s nose
was longer than Mr. Chub’s, but whether it
was not, in the accustomed language of the
country, absolutely a long nose, although
perhaps it might not extend to a quarter of
an English inch. On the other hand, if,
instead of referring to the measure of each
country, we were to refer always to an English
foot, though we should be able to ascertain
the relative portions of space which
all the men to whom we applied our
measure occupied, we should make sad
havoc with the estimates which they and
their countrymen had formed of their own
heights, and many certainly would be considered
as very short who had before always
been considered as very tall. Now it must
be allowed that the value of a commodity,
as it changes with place and time, and
depends upon the wants and caprices of
man and the means of satisfying them, resembles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>more the estimate of tall or short,
broad or narrow, than a portion of space
capable of being ascertained by a measure
unchangeable by time and place.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we speak of the value of silver in
China, we cannot possibly mean the value of
an ounce of Chinese silver brought to London,
where, if it were pure, it would be
precisely of the same value as an ounce of
pure silver which had been in London from
time immemorial. What alone we can correctly
mean is, the estimation in which the
ounce of silver is held in China, determined,
at the time, by the state of the supply compared
with the demand, and ordinarily by the
quantity of Chinese labour and profits necessary
to produce it; and if this be what we
mean by the value of an ounce of silver in
China, there can be no doubt that Chinese
labour, and Chinese labour alone, can measure
it. Even, however, if we mean the
relation of an ounce of silver to all the commodities
in China in succession, it would be
impossible practically to form any approximation
towards a just notion of the result,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>except by referring the silver to Chinese
labour.</p>

<p class='c011'>It might be allowed, perhaps, that labour
would be a still more satisfactory measure
of value, in all countries and at all times,
if the physical force exerted in a day’s
labour were always the same; and probably
this is sometimes not far from being the
case in a few countries as compared with each
other, and more frequently in the same
country at different periods. The English
agricultural labourers in the time of Edward
III., though probably less skilful,
worked, I should conceive, for nearly the
same number of hours, and exerted nearly
the same physical force, as our labourers at
present. Under such circumstances, and in
the same country, agricultural labour seems
to be a measure of value from century to
century calculated to satisfy the scruples of the
most fastidious. But even when it is acknowledged,
that the labourer at different times
and in different countries does <em>not</em> always lay
down the same portion of his ease, his
liberty, and happiness, the quality of labour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>as a measure of value, is not essentially
impaired; and it appears to me always true,
that when commodities in different countries
and at different times have been found to
command the same quantity of the agricultural
labour of each country and time, they
may with propriety be said to have been held
in the same estimation, and considered as of
the same value.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may now proceed to the definition of
some of the most important terms in common
use among political economists, particularly
those which have been most controverted.
Whenever it has been thought necessary either
to deviate from the general rule of employing
terms according to their ordinary meaning,
or to determine between two meanings both
of which have some authorities in their
favour, I have always been guided in my
choice by what appeared to me the superior
practical utility of the meaning selected in explaining
the causes of the wealth of nations.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>The reader will be aware, from the manner
in which I have treated the subject, and the
discussions into which I have allowed myself
to enter, that what I consider as the main
obstacle to a more general agreement among
political economists, is rather the differences
of opinion which have prevailed as to the
classes of objects which are to be separated
from each other by appropriate names, than
as to the names which these classes should
receive. It seems indeed to be pretty
generally and most properly agreed, that the
principal names which have been so long in
use should remain. It would certainly be an
Herculean task to change them, nor would
any change which could be adopted in the
present state of things remove the real difficulties.
It has been most justly observed
by Bacon, that “to say, where notions cannot
be fitly reconciled, that there wanteth a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>term or nomenclature for it, is but a shift of
ignorance.” When some people think that
every sort of gratification, whether arising
from immaterial or material objects, from spiritual
comfort or comfortable clothing, should
be designated by the same appropriate term;
while others think it of great use and importance
that they should be distinguished, it is
obvious that such different notions cannot be
reconciled by a new nomenclature. The grand
preliminary required is that the notions should
be fitly reconciled; and till this is done, a
change of names would be perfectly futile.
Preserving therefore, generally, the old
names, the great practical question is, what
they are to include and what they are to
exclude?</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter X.</span><br /> <span class='large'>DEFINITIONS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>WEALTH.</h3>

<p class='c014'>1.<a id='def1'></a> The material objects necessary, useful or
agreeable to man, which have required some
portion of human exertion to appropriate or
produce.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>UTILITY.</h3>

<p class='c014'>2.<a id='def2'></a> The quality of being serviceable or
beneficial to mankind. The utility of an
object has generally been considered as proportioned
to the necessity and real importance
of these services and benefits.</p>

<p class='c011'>All wealth is necessarily useful; but all
that is useful is not necessarily wealth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VALUE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>3.<a id='def3'></a> Has two meanings—value in use, and
value in exchange.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VALUE IN USE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>4.<a id='def4'></a> Is synonymous with Utility. It rarely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>occurs in political economy, and is never
implied by the word value when used alone.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VALUE, OR VALUE IN EXCHANGE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>5.<a id='def5'></a> The relation of one object to some
other, or others in exchange, resulting from
the estimation in which each is held. When
no second object is specified, the value of a
commodity naturally refers to the causes
which determine this estimation, and the
object which measures it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Value is distinguished from wealth in that
it is not confined to material objects, and is
much more dependent upon scarcity and
difficulty of production.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>6.<a id='def6'></a> The creation of objects which constitute
wealth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PRODUCT, PRODUCE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>7.<a id='def7'></a> The portion of wealth created by production.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SOURCES OF WEALTH.</h3>

<p class='c014'>8.<a id='def8'></a> Land, labour, and capital. The two
original sources, are land and labour; but
the aid which labour receives from capital is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>applied so very early, and is so very necessary
in the production of wealth, that it may
be considered as a third source.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>LAND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>9.<a id='def9'></a> The soil, mines, waters, and fisheries
of the habitable globe. It is the main source
of raw materials and food.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>LABOUR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>10.<a id='def10'></a> The exertions of human beings employed
with a view to remuneration. If the
term be applied to other exertions, they
must be particularly specified.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PRODUCTIVE LABOUR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>11.<a id='def11'></a> The labour which is so directly productive
of wealth as to be capable of estimation
in the quantity or value of the products
obtained.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>UNPRODUCTIVE LABOUR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>12.<a id='def12'></a> All labour which is not directly productive
of wealth. The terms productive and
unproductive are always used by political
economists in a restricted and technical sense
exclusively applicable to the direct production
or non-production of wealth.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>INDUSTRY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>13.<a id='def13'></a> The exertion of the human faculties
and powers to accomplish some desirable
end. No very marked line is drawn in common
language, or by political economists,
between industry and labour; but the term
industry generally implies more superintendence
and less bodily exertion than labour.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>STOCK.</h3>

<p class='c014'>14.<a id='def14'></a> Accumulated wealth, either reserved
by the consumer for his consumption, or kept,
or employed with a view to profit.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CAPITAL.</h3>

<p class='c014'>15.<a id='def15'></a> That portion of the stock of a country
which is kept or employed with a view to
profit in the production and distribution of
wealth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>FIXED CAPITAL.</h3>

<p class='c014'>16.<a id='def16'></a> That portion of stock employed with
a view to profit which yields such profit while
it remains in the possession of the owner.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CIRCULATING CAPITAL.</h3>

<p class='c014'>17.<a id='def17'></a> That portion of stock employed with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>view to profit which does not yield such
profit till it is parted with.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>REVENUE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>18.<a id='def18'></a> That portion of stock or wealth which
the possessor may annually consume without
injury to his permanent resources. It consists
of the rents of land, the wages of labour,
and the profits of stock.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL.</h3>

<p class='c014'>19.<a id='def19'></a> The employment of a portion of revenue
as capital. Capital may therefore increase
without an increase of stock or wealth.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SAVING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>20.<a id='def20'></a> In modern times, implies the accumulation
of capital, as few people now lock up
their money in a box.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RENT OF LAND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>21.<a id='def21'></a> That portion of the produce of land
which remains to the owner after all the outgoings
belonging to its cultivation are paid,
including the ordinary profits of the capital
employed.</p>

<div>

defined, estimated in money.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>GROSS SURPLUS OF THE LAND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>23.<a id='def23'></a> That portion of the produce of land
which is not actually consumed by the cultivators.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>WAGES OF LABOUR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>24.<a id='def24'></a> The remuneration paid to the labourer
for his exertions.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>NOMINAL WAGES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>25.<a id='def25'></a> The wages which the labourer receives
in the current money of the country.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>REAL WAGES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>26.<a id='def26'></a> The necessaries, conveniences, and
luxuries of life which the wages of the
labourer enable him to command.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE RATE OF WAGES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>27.<a id='def27'></a> The ordinary wages paid to the labourer
by the day, week, month, or year,
according to the custom of the place where
he is employed. They are generally estimated
in money.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>THE PRICE OF LABOUR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>28.<a id='def28'></a> Has generally been understood to
mean the average money-price of common
day-labour, and is not therefore different
from the rate of wages, except that it more
specifically refers to money.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE AMOUNT OF WAGES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>29.<a id='def29'></a> The whole earnings of the labourer in
a given time, which may be much more or
much less than the average rate of wages, or
the price of common day-labour.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE PRICE OF EFFECTIVE LABOUR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>30.<a id='def30'></a> The price in money of a given quantity
of human exertion of a given strength and
character, which may be essentially different
from the common price of day-labour, or the
whole money-earnings of the labourer in a
given time.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>ACCUMULATED LABOUR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>31.<a id='def31'></a> The labour worked up in the raw materials
and tools applied to the production of
other commodities.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PROFITS OF STOCK.</h3>

<p class='c014'>32.<a id='def32'></a> When stock is employed as capital in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the production and distribution of wealth, its
profits consist of the difference between the
value of the capital advanced, and the value
of the commodity when sold or used.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE RATE OF PROFITS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>33.<a id='def33'></a> The per centage proportion which the
value of the profits upon any capital bears to
the value of such capital.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE INTEREST OF MONEY.</h3>

<p class='c014'>34.<a id='def34'></a> The net profits of a capital in money
separated from the risk and trouble of employing
it.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE PROFITS OF INDUSTRY, SKILL, AND ENTERPRISE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>35.<a id='def35'></a> That portion of the gross profits of
capital, independent of monopoly, which remains
after deducting the net profits, or the
interest of money.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MONOPOLY PROFITS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>36.<a id='def36'></a> The profits which arise from the employment
of capital where the competition is
not free.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>CONDITIONS OF THE SUPPLY OF COMMODITIES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>37.<a id='def37'></a> The advance of the quantity of accumulated
and immediate labour necessary to
their production, with such a per centage
upon the whole of the advances for the time
they have been employed as is equivalent
to ordinary profits. If there be any other
necessary conditions of the supply arising
from monopolies of any description, or from
taxes, they must be added.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>ELEMENTARY COSTS OF PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>38.<a id='def38'></a> An expression exactly equivalent to
the conditions of the supply.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MEASURE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE SUPPLY, OR OF THE ELEMENTARY COSTS OF PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>39.<a id='def39'></a> The quantity of labour for which the
commodity will exchange, when it is in its
natural and ordinary state.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE VALUE, MARKET VALUE, OR ACTUAL VALUE, OF A COMMODITY AT ANY PLACE OR TIME.</h3>

<p class='c014'>40.<a id='def40'></a> The estimation in which it is held at
that place and time, determined in all cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>by the state of the supply compared with the
demand, and ordinarily by the elementary
costs of production which regulate that state.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE NATURAL VALUE OF A COMMODITY AT ANY PLACE AND TIME.</h3>

<p class='c014'>41.<a id='def41'></a> The estimation in which it is held
when it is in its natural and ordinary state,
determined by the elementary costs of its
production, or the conditions of its supply.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MEASURE OF THE MARKET OR ACTUAL VALUE OF A COMMODITY AT ANY PLACE OR TIME.</h3>

<p class='c014'>42.<a id='def42'></a> The quantity of labour which it will
command or exchange for at that place and
time.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MEASURE OF THE NATURAL VALUE OF A COMMODITY AT ANY PLACE AND TIME.</h3>

<p class='c014'>43.<a id='def43'></a> The quantity of labour for which it
will exchange at that place and time, when it
is in its natural and ordinary state.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THE PRICE, THE MARKET PRICE, OR ACTUAL PRICE OF A COMMODITY AT ANY PLACE AND TIME.</h3>

<p class='c014'>44.<a id='def44'></a> The quantity of money for which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>exchanges at that place and time, the money
referring to the precious metals.</p>

<p class='c014'>45.<a id='def45'></a> The price in money which will pay
the elementary costs of its production, or the
money conditions of its supply.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SUPPLY OF COMMODITIES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>46.<a id='def46'></a> The quantity offered, or ready to be
immediately offered, for sale.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DEMAND FOR COMMODITIES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>47.<a id='def47'></a> Has two distinct meanings: one, in
regard to its extent, or the quantity of
commodities purchased; and the other, in
regard to its intensity, or the sacrifice which
the demanders are able and willing to make
in order to satisfy their wants.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DEMAND IN REGARD TO ITS EXTENT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>48.<a id='def48'></a> The quantity of the commodity purchased,
which generally increases with the
increase of the supply, and diminishes with
the diminution of it. It is often the greatest
when commodities are selling below the costs
of production.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>DEMAND IN REGARD TO ITS INTENSITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>49.<a id='def49'></a> The sacrifice which the demanders are
able and willing to make in order to satisfy
their wants. It is this species of demand
alone which, compared with the supply, determines
prices and values.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EFFECTUAL DEMAND, IN REGARD TO ITS EXTENT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>50.<a id='def50'></a> The quantity of a commodity wanted
by those who are able and willing to pay the
costs of its production.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EFFECTUAL DEMAND, IN REGARD TO ITS INTENSITY.</h3>

<p class='c014'>51.<a id='def51'></a> The sacrifice which the demanders
must make, in order to effectuate the continued
supply of a commodity.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MEASURE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE EFFECTUAL DEMAND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>52.<a id='def52'></a> The quantity of labour for which the
commodity will exchange, when in its natural
and ordinary state.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EXCESS OF THE DEMAND ABOVE THE SUPPLY.</h3>

<p class='c014'>53.<a id='def53'></a> The demand for a commodity is said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>to be in excess above the supply, when,
either from the diminution of the supply, or
the increase of the effectual demand, the
quantity in the market is not sufficient to
supply all the effectual demanders. In this
case the intensity of the demand increases,
and the commodity rises, in proportion to
the competition of the demanders, and the
sacrifice they are able and willing to make
in order to satisfy their wants.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EXCESS OF THE SUPPLY ABOVE THE DEMAND, OR PARTIAL GLUT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>54.<a id='def54'></a> The supply of a commodity is said to
be in excess above the demand, or there is a
partial glut, when, either from the superabundance
of supply, or the diminution of
demand, the quantity in the market exceeds
the quantity wanted by those who are able
and willing to pay the elementary costs of
production. It then falls below these costs
in proportion to the eagerness of the sellers
to sell; and the glut is trifling, or great,
accordingly.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>GENERAL GLUT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>55.<a id='def55'></a> A glut is said to be general, when,
either from superabundance of supply or
diminution of demand, a considerable mass
of commodities falls below the elementary
costs of production.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>A GIVEN DEMAND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>56.<a id='def56'></a> A given demand, in regard to price,
is a given quantity of money intended to be
laid out in the purchase of certain commodities
in a market; and a given demand, in
regard to value, is the command of a given
quantity of labour intended to be employed in
the same way.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VARIATIONS OF PRICES AND VALUES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>57.<a id='def57'></a> Prices and values vary as the demand
directly and the supply inversely. When
the demand is given, prices and values vary
inversely as the supply; when the supply
is given, directly as the demand.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CONSUMPTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>58.<a id='def58'></a> The destruction wholly or in part of
any portions of wealth.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>PRODUCTIVE CONSUMPTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>59.<a id='def59'></a> The consumption or employment of
wealth by the capitalist, with a view to future
production.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>UNPRODUCTIVE CONSUMPTION, OR SPENDING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>60.<a id='def60'></a> The consumption of wealth, as revenue,
with a view to the final purpose of all
production—subsistence and enjoyment; but
not with a view to profit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chapter XI.</span><br /> <span class='large'>OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEFINITIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def1'>1.</a></em> The reader will be aware that, in
almost all definitions, the same meaning may
be conveyed in different language, and that
it is the meaning rather than the mode of
expressing it that should be the main object
of our consideration. The essential question
in the definition of wealth is, whether or not
it should be confined to material objects, and
the reader is already apprised of my reasons
for thinking that it should. Even M. Say,
who admits “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les produits immatériels</span></i>,” allows,
as I have before stated (p. 93), that the multiplication
of them “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne fait rien pour la
richesse</span></i>;” and M. Storch, in his able “<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cours
d’Economie Politique</span></cite>,” though he justly lays
great stress on what he calls <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les biens internes</span></i>,
with a view to civilization and the indirect
production of wealth, confines the term
<em>richesses</em> to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biens externes</span></i>, or material objects;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and according to this meaning treats
of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théorie de la Richesse Nationale</span></cite>, in
the first, and far the largest, part of his
work. Altogether, I can feel no doubt that
some classification of this kind, or some separation
of material from immaterial objects is,
in the highest degree, useful in a definition
of wealth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter part of the definition is of minor
importance. It is intended to exclude such
material objects as air, light, rain, &amp;c.—which,
however necessary and useful to man, are
seldom considered as wealth; and, perhaps,
it is more objectionable to exclude them, by
the introduction of the term exchangeable
value into a definition of wealth, than in the
mode which has been adopted. If the latter
clause were not added, the only consequence
would be, that, in comparing different
countries together, such objects as air, light,
&amp;c., would be neglected as common quantities.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def2'>2.</a></em> I have already alluded to the
manner in which M. Say has applied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>term Utility. His language cannot be considered
as consistent, when he says that the
price of an article is the measure of its utility,
although it might be, according to his own
expression, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la chose la plus inutile</span></i>.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> It is much
better for the science of political economy that
the term should retain its natural and ordinary
meaning. All wealth is no doubt useful, but
there are so very many immaterial, and some
material objects which are highly useful, and
yet not wealth, that there can be no excuse
for confounding them. M. Storch has not
escaped the same kind of error.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def5'>5.</a></em> Two articles are never exchanged
with each other without a previous estimation
being formed of the value of each, by a
reference to the wants of mankind and the
means of production. This general and most
important relation to the means of production,
and the labour which represents these
means, seems to be quite forgotten by those
who imagine that there is no relation implied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>when the value of a commodity is mentioned
without specific reference to some other commodity.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Say, under the head <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Valeur des Choses</span></cite>,
observes, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est la quantité d’autres choses
évaluables qu’on peut obtenir en échange
d’elle</span>.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a> This is a most vague and uncertain
definition, and much less satisfactory than the
general power of purchasing.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Storch says, that “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la valeur des choses,
c’est leur utilité relative</span>;” but this certainly
cannot be said unless we completely change
the natural and ordinary meaning either of
utility or value.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither M. Say nor M. Storch has sufficiently
distinguished utility, wealth, and value.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def6'>6.</a></em> The term creation is not here
meant to apply to the creation of matter, but
to the creation and production of the objects
which have been defined to be wealth.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Defs. <a href='#def11'>11</a> and <a href='#def12'>12</a>.</em> If wealth be confined to
material objects, it must be allowed to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>peculiarly convenient and useful, in explaining
the causes of the wealth of nations, to have
some appropriate term for that species of
labour which directly produces wealth; and as
the principal founder of the science of political
economy has used the terms <em>productive
labour</em> in the restricted sense necessary for
this special purpose, perhaps few objections
would have been made to it, if it had not
involved all other kinds of labour, however
useful and important, under the apparently
disparaging designation of unproductive. This
is a consequence, no doubt, to be regretted:
yet, when it has been repeatedly stated that
the term unproductive, as applied by Adam
Smith, in no degree impeaches the utility and
importance of such labour, but merely implies
that it does not directly produce gross wealth,
the mere name ought not to decide against a
classification for which it appears from experience
that it is very difficult to find a
satisfactory substitute.</p>

<p class='c011'>In M. Storch’s “<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Considérations sur la
Nature du Revenu National</span></cite>,” he does not
appear to me to give a correct view of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Adam Smith means by productive labour.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a>
The difficulty of classification above alluded
to appears strikingly in this treatise. There
is some plausibility in the system, and
it is explained with ingenuity and ability;
but I think that the adoption of it would
destroy all precision in the science of political
economy.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Defs. <a href='#def19'>19</a> and <a href='#def20'>20</a>.</em> I have never been able
to understand how the accumulation of capital
and the difference between saving and spending
can be distinctly explained, if we call all
labour equally productive.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def23'>23.</a></em> It is this gross surplus of the
land which furnishes the means of subsistence
to the inhabitants of towns and cities. Besides
the rents of land, which are powerfully effective
in this respect, a large part of what,
in the division of the produce of land, would
fall to the shares of the farmers and labourers,
is exchanged by them for other objects of
convenience and gratification, thus giving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>main necessaries of life to a great mass of
persons not immediately connected with the
soil. The proportion which this mass of
persons may bear to the cultivators will
depend upon the natural fertility of the soil,
and the skill with which it has been improved,
and continues to be worked.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Defs. <a href='#def28'>28</a> and <a href='#def30'>30</a>.</em> In a valuable publication
on the <cite>Price of Corn, and Wages of Labour</cite>,
by Sir Edward West, which has just fallen
into my hands, he proposes that the <em>price of
labour</em> should mean the sum paid for a given
quantity of labour of a given character. I
quite agree with him in thinking that it would
be useful to have some appropriate term to
express this meaning; but, as the <em>price of
labour</em> has certainly not hitherto been used in
this sense, and as it would be, in almost all
cases, extremely difficult to give an answer
to a question respecting the price of labour so
understood, it would certainly be proper to
vary the expression in some degree, in order
to prepare people for a new meaning. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Definition 30, therefore, I have given this
meaning to <em>The price of effective labour</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def31'>31.</a></em> It would save time and circumlocution,
which is one of the great objects
of appropriate terms, if, in speaking of
the labour worked up in commodities, the
labour worked up in the capital necessary
to their production were designated by
the term <em>accumulated labour</em>, as contradistinguished
from the <em>immediate labour</em> employed
by the last capitalist. We must
always recollect, however, that labour is not
the only element worked up in capital.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def38'>38.</a></em> I have used the word <em>elementary</em>,
in order to show that money-costs are not
meant. On account of the doubt which may
arise in this respect when the term <em>costs of
production</em> is used alone, and the further
doubt, whether ordinary profits are always
included, I am decidedly of opinion that
<em>the conditions of the supply</em> is a more expressive
and less uncertain term for the same
meaning. I do not find, however, that generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>it is so well understood. I have defined,
therefore, <em>the costs of production</em> with
the addition of the word <em>elementary</em>, and
including profits, as having precisely the
same meaning as the conditions of the supply.
I once thought it might be better not
to include profits in costs of production; but
as Adam Smith has included them, and more
particularly as the profits worked up in the
capital necessary to any production must form
a part of the advances or <em>costs</em> in any sense
in which the word costs can be used, I think it
best, on the whole, to include necessary profits
in the elementary costs of production.
They are obviously included in the necessary
conditions of the supply.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Defs. <a href='#def39'>39</a> and <a href='#def40'>40</a>.</em> In speaking, of the quantity
of labour for which a commodity will
exchange, as a measure either of the conditions
of its supply or of its value, it must
always be understood, that the different kinds
of labour which may have been employed to
produce it, must be reduced to labour of one
description and of the lowest denomination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>namely, common agricultural day-labour, estimated
on an average throughout the year.
This is the kind of labour which is always
referred to when labour is spoken of as a
measure.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def57'>57.</a></em> It is not true, as stated by M.
Say, that prices rise in the direct ratio of the
<em>quantity</em> demanded, and the inverse ratio of
the <em>quantity</em> supplied.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> They only vary in
this way, when the demand is understood
to mean the sacrifice which the demanders
are able and willing to make, in order to
supply themselves with what they want;
which may be represented in regard to price
by the quantity of money ready to be employed
in purchases in a market. When the
demand for <em>labour</em> is spoken of, it can only
relate to <em>extent</em>; and a greater demand can
only signify a power of commanding a greater
<em>quantity</em> of labour.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Def. <a href='#def59'>59.</a></em> The only productive consumption,
properly so called, is the consumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>or destruction of wealth by capitalists with
a view to reproduction. This is the only
marked line of distinction which can be
drawn between productive and unproductive
consumption. The workman whom the capitalist
employs certainly consumes that part
of his wages which he does not save, as
revenue, with a view to subsistence and enjoyment;
and not as capital, with a view to
production. He is a productive consumer to
the person who employs him, and to the
state, but not, strictly speaking, to himself.
Consumption is the great purpose and end
of all production. The consumption of wealth,
as revenue, with a view to support and enjoyment,
is even more necessary and important
than the consumption of wealth as capital;
but their effects are essentially different in
regard to the direct production of wealth, and
they ought therefore to be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>I am far from meaning to present the foregoing
definitions to the notice of the reader
as in any degree complete; either in regard
to extent, or correctness. In extent, they
have been purposely limited, and in regard
to correctness, I am too well aware of the
difficulty of the subject to think that I have
succeeded in making my definitions embrace
all I wish, and exclude all I wish. I am
strongly, indeed, disposed to believe, that in
the sciences of morals, politics, and political
economy, which will not admit of a change
in the principal terms already in use, the
full attainment of this object is impossible;
yet a nearer approach to it is always something
gained. I should not indeed have been
justified in offering these definitions to the
public, if I had not thought that they were,
on the whole, less objectionable, and would
be more useful in explaining the causes of
the wealth of nations than any which I had
seen. But I am conscious of some anomalies,
and probably there are some more of which
I am not conscious. Knowing, however, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the attempt to remove them might destroy
useful classifications, I shall not consider a
few individual cases, of little importance, as
valid objections.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is known that Adam Smith gave few
regular definitions; but the meanings in
which he used his terms may be collected
from the context, and to these I have, in a
considerable degree, adhered. For some I
have been indebted to M. Say; others are
my own; and in all, I have endeavoured to
follow the rules for the definition and use of
terms laid down at the beginning of this
treatise. I shall consider my object as fully
answered, if what I have done, should succeed
in drawing that degree of attention to
the subject which may lead to the production
of something of the same kind, more correct
and more useful, and so convincing as to be
generally adopted.</p>

the demand of every individual were equal to his supply,
in the correct sense of the expression, it would be
a proof that he could always sell his commodity for the
costs of production, including fair profits; and then even
a <em>partial</em> glut would be impossible. The argument
proves too much. It is very strange that Mr. Mill
should not have seen what appears to be so very obvious,—that
supply must always be proportioned to

but the question whether British woollens find an

upon their purchasing the same quantity of tobacco as
usual, but upon whether the tobacco, or whatever the
returns may be, will purchase the British money or the
British labour necessary to enable the woollen manufacturer
to carry on his business successfully. If both
woollen manufactures and tobacco are below the costs
of production in money or labour, both parties may be
carrying on a losing trade, at the time when the rate at

<p class='c011'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. It is quite astonishing that political economists of
reputation should be inclined to resort to any kind of
illustration, however clumsy and inapplicable, rather
than refer to money. I suppose they are afraid of the
imputation of thinking that wealth consists in money.
But though it is certainly true that wealth does not consist
in money, it is equally true that money is a most
powerful agent in the distribution of wealth; and those
who, in a country where all exchanges are practically
effected by money, continue the attempt to explain the
principles of demand and supply, and the variations
of wages and profits, by referring chiefly to hats, shoes,
corn, suits of clothing, &amp;c., must of necessity fail.</p>

Lord Lauderdale’s definition of wealth—<em>all that man
desires as useful and delightful to him</em>; but they apply
with nearly equal force to Mr. Macculloch’s present definition,
which is limited to those objects which possess
exchangeable value. According to Mr. Macculloch’s
own statement, health is purchased from the physician,
and the gratification derived from acting from the actor;
and it must be allowed that it is impossible to enjoy the
benefits of civil and religious liberty without paying
those who administer a good government. It has been
said by Mr. Hallam, with some truth, that the liberties
of England were chiefly obtained by successive purchases
from the crown.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. This is very justly stated in Mr. Mill’s “Elements
of Political Economy,” ch. iv. sec. i. p. 219, 2d edit.:
both Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Mill, indeed, fully allow the
distinction between productive and unproductive labour.
M. Say, though he calls the labour of the menial servant
productive, makes a distinction between the labour
which is productive of <em>material</em> products and the labour
which is productive of <em>immaterial</em> products. Of the
latter products he says, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“En favorisant leur multiplication,
on ne fait rien pour la richesse, on ne fait que
pour la consommation.”—<em>Table Analytique</em>, liv. i. ch.
13</span>. This is a most characteristic difference; and
though I prefer the classification of Adam Smith, as
more simple, I should allow that, on these principles,
the causes of the wealth of nations may be clearly explained.
But I own myself utterly at a loss to conceive
how they can be explained, if all labour be considered
as equally productive.</p>

in reality, deserted him, and agrees in substance with
Adam Smith. According to the new meaning, which
Mr. Macculloch has given to the term profits—the
quantity of labour required to produce a commodity, is
precisely equal to the quantity of labour for which it
will ordinarily exchange, and certainly not equal to

making a rash statement; but that a proposal directly
involving the discontinuance of the division of labour
should, in a civilized country, be repeated over and
over again by succeeding writers, and considered as an
<em>obvious resource</em> in a sudden fall of profits, absolutely
passes my comprehension. What a strange and most
inapt illustration too, is it to talk about the possessors
of broad cloths wanting to change them for silks!
Who ever heard of a great producer of any commodity
wishing to obtain an equivalent for it in some <em>one</em> other
sort of completed commodity? If he is to produce
what he wants, it must not be silks, but raw materials,
tools, corn, meat, coats, hats, shoes and stockings, &amp;c.

value of the capital employed to produce it. The question
still remains, how is the value of the capital determined?
As to what the author says, p. 202, about the

<p class='c011'><a href='#r80'>80</a>. It has always been a matter of great surprise to
me that I should have been accused of <em>arbitrarily</em>
adopting labour as the measure of value. If there be
not a most marked and characteristic distinction between
labour and any <em>product</em> of labour, I do not know
where a characteristic distinction between two objects
is to be found; and surely I have stated this distinction
often enough, and brought forward the peculiar qualities
of labour as my reasons for thinking that it may
be taken as a measure of value. Opinions may differ
as to the sufficiency of these reasons, or as to the
degree of accuracy with which it will serve the purpose
of a measure. But how it can be said that I have
adopted it arbitrarily, is quite unintelligible to me. If
I had merely stated, that I had adopted it because it
was the main element in the natural costs of production,
there could have been no ground for such a
charge.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r84'>84</a>. I am very ready to include myself among those
political economists who have not been sufficiently
attentive to this subject.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f85'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r85'>85</a>. If in a foreign country, in which the relation of
money to men and labour was unknown to us, we were
told that a quarter of corn was selling for four ounces
of silver, we should not know whether there was a
famine, and corn was held in the highest estimation, or
whether there was a glut of corn, and it was held in the
lowest estimation. The very term estimation, as applied
to commodities, must of necessity refer to man
and labour.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f86'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. It is a truth fruitful in important consequences,
that the labour which commodities will command when
in their natural state, by representing accurately the
quantity of labour and profits necessary to produce
them, must represent accurately the effectual demand
for them. And this holds good at different places and
times, referring of course to the labour of the same
description at each place and time.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. What could give us any information respecting
the scarcity of a commodity in China, or the state of its
supply as compared with the demand, but a reference
to Chinese labour?</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r89'>89</a>. M. Say’s comprehensive expression, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Services
productifs</span></i>,” includes profits and rents as well as labour;
but it is certain that labour will measure accurately the
value of the whole amount of these services.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f90'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r90'>90</a>. If this concession be once made, the whole question
respecting labour as a measure of value is at once
decided.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r92'>92</a>. I own that I was myself for a very long time of this
opinion; but I am now perfectly convinced that I was
wrong, and that Adam Smith was quite right in the
prevailing view which he took of value, though he did
not always strictly adhere to it. I am also convinced
that it would be a great improvement to the language
of political economy, if, whenever the term value, or
value in exchange, is mentioned without specific reference,
it should always be understood to mean value in
exchange for labour,—the great instrument of production,
and primary object given in exchange for every
thing that is wealth; in the same manner as, when the
price of a commodity is mentioned without specific
reference, it is always understood to mean price in
money—the universal medium of exchange, and practical
measure of relative value. I am further convinced
that the view of value here taken throws considerable
light on the nature of demand and the means of expressing
and measuring it, and that just view of value
is absolutely necessary to a correct explanation of rents,
profits, and wages. These convictions on my mind,
which have acquired increase of strength the longer I
have considered the subject, must be my apology to
the reader for dwelling on it longer than, in considering
it cursorily, he may think it deserves.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. It is specifically on this ground that I think the
meaning of the term Wealth should be confined to
material objects; that productive labour should be
confined to that labour alone which is directly productive
of wealth; and that value, or value in exchange,
when no specific object is referred to, should mean
value in exchange for the means of production, of which
labour, the great instrument of production, is alone the
representative.</p>
